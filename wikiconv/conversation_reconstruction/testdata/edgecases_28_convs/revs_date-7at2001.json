I too believe that God is much more interested in our '''character''' than our '''comfort'''.  However, I do find your concept of Natural Evil a bit puzzling.

I do not wish to diminish in the least the amount of grief that their families and indeed our entire community went through.  But I will say this, that our community pulled together around these families, and absolutely outpoured our love onto them.

He did, however, promise us comfort in our times of sorrow and I can tell you from personal experience that he does deliver.\n\n\n\n--RaviDesai.\n\n----\n\nRavi - One of Webster's definitions of the noun \"evil\" is something that brings sorrow, distress or calamity.  That leaves plenty of room for Larry's natural evils.  If you read the next to last paragraph of his essay/lecture, you see the outline of your own argument above.  You will also see that his conclusion is that the argument claiming that the existence of evil disproves God, fails.  A conclusion which you obviously share.  In very dry and \"clinical\" terms, he has actually made the same argument to which you bring a wonderfully huma perspective, above.  I think you'll agree his article is not in itself defective, and deserves a careful reading to the end.\n\n----\n\nAyeSpy, I did read his article carefully, I don't disagree with the result all.  It is quite clear to me that we share quite similar views.  What I disagreed with is calling a natural phenomenon \"evil\".  However, by your Webster's definition, perhaps I need to recant that.  But for me, evil was not the result, but the intent.  In other words, you could do evil by intent, even if the result was \"good\".  The reverse also true.  Since a tornado cannot show intent, I have a difficult time labelling it evil.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of my post I indicated that I agreed with Larry that God is more interested in our Character than in our Comfort.  I said I agreed with him because, while he did not use those exact words, that is essentially what the result of his argument is.  That which does not kill us outright makes us stronger, and gives us more moral character.  In general, this is quite true, as the example I gave indicated as well.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don't think we need to view everything bad that happens to us as something evil that God passed our way in order to grow our moral character.\n\n----\n\nJust so.  One needs to take care to distiguish the moral concept of evil, which implies intent, from the generic evil as a noun, which is basically \"something bad.\"  When you look at evil in the dictionary as an adjective, all the value judgement stuff is included.\n\n\n\nThere are gobs and gobs of different conceptions of even the one Christian God, from person to person and sect to sect.  Some will tell you that an anthropomorhic God, possessed of human-style motivations while being omniscient and omnipotent, has the time, attention and resources and what's more the will, to attend to each and every one of His children on earth, map out a specific plan for them, and then watch and judge each individually moment-to-moment as to whether that individual accepts and follows God's plan for his life, or rejects it and strays.  Theoretically, those disposed to go along with the program get to heaven.  In such a scenario, literally everything which happens to one is directly and literally part of God's plan, and how one responds to the various tests presented help determine his worth as a potential heaven-dweller.  For the sake of economy, God could test hundreds or thousands at a time by smiting them with a tornado or a tsunami.\n\n\n\nLarry's comments would fall right in line with that conception of God, or a very similar one.\n\n\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, there is a Christian theory that God is not matter but spirit, and when he created man in his own image, that was a siritual image and man is therefore a soul like unto God.  This same God, omniscient and omnipotent, set up a universe full of traps once his children rebelled against him (ate of the fruit of the tree of knowlege of good and evil) and cast them out into it, knowing all the while that only those with a pure soul and loving heart would be able to escape it.  Those who valued matter over spirit would be lost forever.  His \"plan\" for salvation was general, not specific to this or that individual.  When Man in his conceit strayed too far, He tried wiping them out and starting over with Noah, but material man was still too in love with the world.  So, He sent His son (reduntant as all all men are his literal children, born of his will) to remind everyone, \"Hey - love one another, and follow the path I set out, or you ain't never gettin' home.  There's only one road back to the Father, and you're not on it.\"  Then He went about His divine business, whatever that may be, checking in now and again to see how the kids are doing.\n\n\n\n(These are not theories I made up, but I've had both of them preached to me)\n\n\n\nUnder the second theory, God is \"more concerned about our character than our comfort,\" and has set out signposts to be followed.  Those who follow the road get to come home and dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  This would be a God who would neither cause nor prevent tornadoes or eathquakes, but whose children would have an infinite variety of opportunities to learn from their lives and either move closer to Him or farther away.  In either case he would love them all, and mourn the lost.  Larry's argument still works under this scenario, but the literalness with which this or that person is \"tested\" would no longer apply.\n\n\n\nHowever you believe is up to you, but you can look at Larry's article on its bare merits and then suggest or make changes which retain the arguments but perhaps open the way for a wider range of interpretation of the same Omniscient, Omnipotent, and All-loving God.  No?\n\n----\n\nHi, Ravi!  Thanks for the thoughtful comments!  You wrote:\n\n:However, I do find your concept of Natural Evil a bit puzzling.

God is not disproven by the ProblemOfEvil argument, as one of its necessary premises fails.  This, in combination with the second-to-last paragraph seem compatible with Ravi's stance, just not as emotionally so.\n\n\n\nObviously, if you believe an all-loving God cannot permit evil, then you must bow to the force of the original argument.  But then you would also have to believe that a loving mother could not visit unpleasantness and therefore discipline upon her child, since the child obviously would not find discipline pleasant.  A Christian believer already believes, likely, that scripture supports discipline as essential to love.  For this reason, It would appear futile for an atheist to attemt to pursuade a Christian with the ProblemOfEvil.  He might pursuade non-believers, but then what would be the point?

There are a variety of political spectra, but most people have a clear concept of the one to which \"left\" and \"right\" refer.  In fact, if you look at the one presented by the advocates for self-government, you will notice that the horizontal axis is the same left-right spectrum everyone else uses.  So while people may debate over the precise definition of that axis, its existence is not nearly so controversial.\n\n\n\nThe other thing is that the particular diagram to which you refer is fairly non-discriminatory.  Inasmuchas it can't distinguish between libertarianism and anarchism - one of which has policies much like capitalism, one of which has policies much like socialism - and again between fascism and marxism.  In short, they have identified different ideologies by pinching the diagram off into a diamond, which is probably more for the purposes of popularizing libertarianism (something the site obviously tries to do) then accuracy. -- JoshuaGrosse\n\n----\n\nJoshua - The two axes are 'personal self-government' and 'economic self-government'.  Which is the horizontal axis?\n\n\n\n''Economic self-government: the one that showed up as horizontal on the chart, of course. :)''\n\n\n\n****\n\nBut personal self-government is equally horizontal on the chart.  The axes lie parallel like two AA batteries in a walkman: The positive next to the others negative.\n\n\n\nThe diagram can be represented like this:\n\n   ++\n\n +-  -+\n\n   --\n\n\n\n''Oh...I see what they're doing.  In that case the corners of the graph are grossly mislabeled - a completely totalitarian government is authoritarian whether or not they allow a free market.  But all in all, it's the square is suggested, only tilted in a non-standard way.  Usually left-right is portrayed as an economic spectrum.  I'm very sorry for the confusion.  I still say the source is biased, though.'' -- JoshuaGrosse\n\n****\n\nAlso - I do not agree that there is similarity between socialism and anarchism.  As I would define them, socialism attempts to maintain social order with political institutions, and without cultural or economic institutions.  Anarchism seeks to maintain social order with economic and cultural institutions, and without political institutions.  As they are conventionally understood, socialism means more government, anarchism no government.  So even if you don't like my definition, common usage place these two at opposite extremes.\n\n\n\n''Just as libertarian is usually applied in a narrow sense to exclude libertarian socialists (~anarcho-syndicalists), it seems anarchism is usually applied in a narrow sense to exclude anarcho-capitalists (~free market libertarians).  It's in this sense that I was using the term.  Obviously anarcho-syndicalism has strong ties to socialism and free market libertarianism has strong ties to capitalism, but the two systems aren't distinguished on the diamond.  A square or circle would be much better in terms of actually representing ideologies.''\n\n\n\n''Other than those, though, I don't really have any complaints other than perhaps a slight editorial tone (''fear'' the future and wish to control it).  And, of course, none of this is meant as negative criticism, my being too uncertain to try writing political articles myself. :) -- JoshuaGrosse''\n\n----\n\nTim, you wrote:\n\n:In modern WesterN countries, the spectrum is usually defined along an axis of ConservatisM (\"the right\") versus SocialisM (\"the left\", called liberalism in the [[United States]]).\n\nI think we need to find a better word for The Right than \"conservatism\" because that means, after all, something quite different in countries where the tradition for decades has been socialism.  Perhaps there isn't a single word--perhaps it's simply \"support for traditional values and some support for capitalism.\"\n\n", "year": 2001, "page_title": "Talk:PoliticalSpectrum", "model": "wikitext", "rev_id": "272933", "page_id": "23991471", "page_namespace": "1"}

The shared codebase for experiments on Wikimedia, part of [the Study of
Harassment and its
Impact](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Study_of_harassment_and_its_impact), and [the WikiDetox Project](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Detox).

This project consists of trying to reconstruct the conversation structure from Wikipedia diffs, human and machine annotation of the structured conversations, and analysis of the impact of harassment and other toxic contributions, and also experimention with ways to visualize this information and make it interesting and useful to Wikipedians.

# WikiDetox

This repository is the shared codebase for experiments on the Wikimedia as part of the [Study of
harassment and its
impact](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Study_of_harassment_and_its_impact), and [the WikiDetox Project](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Detox).

Part of this research is experimenting with ways to visualize the structure of conversation and the toxicity of contributions (measured by the [Perspective API](https://www.perspectivepai.com)), and the resluting impact on wikipedia.

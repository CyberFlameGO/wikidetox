# PerspectiveAPI WikiDetox Visualization

This repository is the shared codebase for experiments to visualize the
conversation structure, the toxicity of contributions (measured by the
[Perspective API](https://www.perspectivepai.com)), and the resluting
impact on wikipedia. It is being developed as part of the [Study of
harassment and its
impact](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Study_of_harassment_and_its_impact).

## Notes

This code is an experimental project using the Perspective API; it is not an official Google product.

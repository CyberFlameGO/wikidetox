708203907.10076.10076,"==Remove disputed paragraph==
Please remove the disputed paragraph that was added [EXTERNAL_LINK: here] while the discussion of whether or not to include contentious material continues above. In its current form, it does not represent a fair summary of the political and biographical ramifications of the [WIKI_LINK: 2012 Benghazi attack] as it pertains to the subject of this article. Moreover, in what arguably can be considered a violation of [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], it makes allegations about former Secretary Hillary Clinton (who is not the subject of this article) and does so with a dated source of dubious quality. A fuller justification can be found in an earlier section of this talkpage.
: '''Not done:''' That paragraph has been repeatedly inserted and removed over the past couple of days. I'm not adding or removing anything related to this without consensus. — Martin ( ·
::[REPLY_TO: MSGJ] - Can you make the small correction, as noted above? Right now there is a factual error, but simply removing the words ""Four Americans;"" from the beginning of the second sentence will resolve it for now. I wouldn't think that anyone would have a problem with this. Hopefully in the coming days we can get some more people involved, have a productive discussion and come to a consensus on how to proceed with this paragraph. -  ''''
::I wasn't going to ask for a removal or bug  about protecting the page(without a request), but this answer is both unacceptable and you should not be the one deciding. You protect the page with the contested paragraph still in the article. If editors challenge an addition to the article, it's incumbent upon the editors who want the information placed into the article to achieve consensus to add it into the article, not the editors who do not want the edit placed into the article. That's Wiki policy 101.
:::That's generally correct, but with all the to and fro I can't actually determine what the ""status quo"" is. The diff supplied by Scjessey is certainly not the first insertion of this paragraph. That said, if we can get a rough consensus for removal I will do so. — Martin ( ·
::::Still though, that is kind of backwards. The consensus should be achieved before it is added, not to remove contested material in a BLP. It was first added [EXTERNAL_LINK: here], the version before it was added is [EXTERNAL_LINK: here]. My problems with the edit are listed [EXTERNAL_LINK: here]. I do not think the article should include the edit until it is discussed and the problems are addressed, but I am will to say consensus is against me after a time, if that is the case. But it should not be edit warred into the article and have the page protected to make it impossible to remove. Thanks.
:::::It seems it was added earlier than this, sometime in February, so that is not the first time is was inserted. I can only point you towards [WIKI_LINK: meta:The Wrong Version|The Wrong Version].

:::The accusations against the President and Secretary of State, members of one political party, were made more or less exclusively by operatives of the opposing party for political purposes. That's the definition of partisan, on one side or another of a political division. -
::::Wait, whom precisely are you accusing of being operatives of what, exactly?
:::::Whom = politicians and pundits accusing Obama and Clinton of misdeeds and failures relating to the Benghazi attacks; what = United States Republican Party. It's pretty basic. -

::::::Um, ok... well, here at Wikipedia we cite facts reported in [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS|reliable sources], such as media outlets, not ""operatives from opposing political parties"". These facts are not always flattering to the subject of the BLP article they're included in, but that is not a factor. As long as the info is relevant, neutral and sourced there is no reason to exclude it. -  ''''
:::::::Those are some of the threshold inclusion criteria, yes. The information here isn't relevant to the biography, it isn't factual, and it is not sourced. In fact, the source cited here says exactly what I pointed out, that it was the subject of partisan politics, not criticism. That sort of thing belongs in articles about party politics, and in fact it is in those articles,  -
::::::::Well, the relevance is debatable, but AFAIC, the significance of the event is what makes it relevant. The factuality is not in dispute. What is written in that passage are indeed facts. And of course it's sourced, see the attached ref. If you want to dispute that, then [WIKI_LINK: WP:RSN] is the place to go. What this boils down to is a case of [WIKI_LINK: WP:IDONTLIKEIT]. -  ''''

You can continue to claim that it's only because we don't like it, but that is shown to be a straw man. And it is up to those in favor of inclusion to establish consensus to add the paragraph, which has not happened.

Right, what Wikidemon said. As should be obvious. And as I've outlined in a minor way above. Which discussion was ended by protecting the page with the edit included in the article. And the page was protected not for 24 hours, but for 48 hours.
:The text in question states a fact-that Obama and Clinton received substantial criticism regarding their handling of the events. Nowhere does it claim that these criticisms are justified or not. I do not believe that anyone supporting the inclusion of the paragraph has attempted to argue either way on the talk page. Rather, it is people who oppose the inclusion of these words that are employing their own political beliefs and trying to blame everything on the Republicans. Under the guise of following BLP rules, they are attempting to delete a totally factual, relevant, and well-sourced sentence. , you have said this:

:As has been identified above, the information is entirely relevant to the biography. The fact that a foreign ambassador was killed in the line of duty, which had not happened previously since 1988, makes it so. Furthermore, is entirely factual once the minor numbering errors are removed. Clinton has been investigated for her conduct and many have claimed that she did not do enough to ensure the safety of the Americans in the country. The Fox News article clearly states that. How are these comments not criticism? Finally, I don't even know what to say about your ridiculous claim that the content is ""not sourced.""
:Only 6 Ambassadors have been [WIKI_LINK: Ambassadors_of_the_United_States#Ambassadors_killed_in_office|killed in office] in the history the US. -  ''''
::If you're referring to the  May 12, 2014 AP news piece, published by Fox, it does not use the word ""criticism"" once, much less say that Obama or Clinton received it. Quite the contrary, it describes the incident as a ""controversy"" and a ""political rallying cry"", saying that ""political reaction to the Benghazi attack quickly formed along partisan lines that hold fast to this day"" and that ""Clinton is the prime political target of the Benghazi probes"". Not sourced means failing [WIKI_LINK: WP:V], statements are made in the article text that are not traced to any source. Linking to a source that says something else does not source the content. -

In response to concerns, I typed the words ""Benghazi criticism"" into Google Search. I reached ] article from ABC News as the 5th option. In addition to having the word ""Criticisms"" in the title, it also includes that word or some derivative of it 7 times in the body of the article. What more do you need?
:Nope. This does not stand for the proposition that Obama received substantial criticism, or Clinton either. It reports that in a ""leaked chapter"" of Clinton's now-released book, ''Hard Choices'', she refutes Republican critics vis-a-vis Benghazi. 'Criticism' and 'critic' are different words. Criticism, in the sense used, is an expression of disapproval of somebody or something based on a good faith perception of faults, motives, or mistakes. A critic of someone is not making judgments about whether to approve or disapprove, they are a detractor. This piece, and the great majority of others covering her book chapter, describe this as a reaction to Republican critics, not to widespread disapproval. -
Checking back here to see if any consensus has developed yet, but I can't see any. I've added a low profile maintenance template, to indicate there is some dispute over the inclusion. In the end, if there is no consensus for inclusion it should probably be removed I guess. — Martin ( ·
:We're going to remove content just because a couple of users [WIKI_LINK: WP:IDLI|don't like it]? While there is always room for improvement, I think this is backwards - without consensus to remove, it should stay. -  ''''
::Seriously - what's it going to take? Here's a short list mentioning response to Obama being criticized over Benghazi.
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: LA Times - U.S. officials counter criticism in Benghazi attack]
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: NPR - After Benghazi Hearings, Flurry Of Concern Unsettled]
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: CNN - White House under assault over Obamacare, NSA, Benghazi]
::This is, of course leaving out the apparently unacceptable fox news articles, and any outlet that might have even a small non-left tilt. He has pretty clearly received substantial criticism regarding Benghazi.
:::No, no, and no. Quite likely nothing is going to help because what you are trying to source — that Obama was the subject of criticism over Benghazi, as opposed to partisan political detractors, does not appear to be what the neutral mainstream sources report. If we get past that, or found language describing it like the sources do as a partisan controversy rather than a criticism, we have a weight issue. Is it really biographically significant about the President that this one controversy, among twenty or thirty that his Republican detractors tried to hang on him, became a big deal for them in 2014-2015? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. We don't report all the controversies from earlier news cycles (Ayers, the birthers, etc.) but we do report at least one in passing, resigning from Jeremiah Wright's church, but that one, involving his religious affiliation, does seem more biographical and directly related to him. -
::::The simple fact is that there is already a section for Libya. It's entirely appropriate to include the Benghazi attack and the fact that an ambassador was killed. Can we agree on at least that much?
::::As for any criticism or fallout faced by Obama and his cabinet, I'm sure if we add some additional sources, we can agree what should (or shouldn't) be added and how it should be worded. -  ''''
:::The ""small non-left tilt"" jab is cute, but irrelevant. Those sources still state the attacks are from Republicans and there is no mainstream criticism of Obama for a terrorist attack on an Embassy based in Libya. As for edit warring the paragraph into the article and then claiming you need consensus to remove it, that's absurd, and shows that editors have no real understanding of Wiki policy.
::::So, just because it's from Republicans means the criticism is both invalid, and non-mainstream - if I'm interpreting your comment correctly? I've been around for about 10 years, I'm not a new editor.
:::::, you have claimed that these ""criticisms"" are not what ""neutral mainstream sources"" report upon. One of the articles cited came from CNN. CNN and Fox are both mainstream sources. Fox is often considered slightly right-leaning, while CNN is often considered slightly left-leaning, although they are both neutral enough to generally be considered mainstream. ""Criticism"" is a totally accurate word, and can be used to describe those who claim that Clinton and Obama did not adequately prepare for or deal with the crisis. , I believe that  is absolutely right. Articles report upon comments and criticism from all fronts. Regarding your edit warring comments, Wikipedia policy clearly states that it takes two to edit war. You cannot blame it all on a different group of editors simply because they disagree with you. With this statement, as well as various attempts to inject your own political philosophy into the article, I now question your understanding of Wikipedia policy. I would now like to pose a question to everyone. '''At what point in the article is it stated that Obama and Clinton are responsible for what happened in Benghazi?'''

704547928.14.14,"BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. Then what kind of show their politicians will have, I can also tell you now. First, they would further proclaim that they are the masters of this land, whites are immigrants from Europe, for the last few decades whites hinder the immigration issue on the latino, they will ask whites apology, and require constant apology even want an apology written into the Constitution, in order to approve latinos with the naturally born owned rights of the land. WASP created the modern civilization on this primitive land, and instantly turned into second-class citizens and foreign sojourners. Latinos will require a fully representing of the government, for revenge, they will further squeeze out the white forces from various government departments, the easiest way is to open the borders and let 100 million illegal immigrants enter the United States, in short time to obtain a residence permit and the right to vote. Any objections raised by whites, will be deducted racism hat.
After completion of the political siege followed is the economy. They will clearly require Latinos in economic activity must occupy most of proportion, they will use government power to intervene directly, whites will be forced to withdraw and abandon all economic activities. Latino government officials at all levels will use the power in their hands, full penetration into various socio-economic levels. The combination of power and money, then that is a comprehensive social corruption. To get any of the white business survival and development in this society, not by technological innovation, production efficiency and improve service levels, but to rely on bribery of government officials at all levels, and the appropriate government officials get a lot of opportunities for corruption in this way. This is a typical Latin America bureaucratic economy. Under this social environment, WASP wisdom and creativity will disappear, which is what these politicians want: completely destroy any whites’ confidence and the demands of society, in order to consolidate the power base of Latino politicians. As for the collapse of social economy and severe recession, which is not within the scope of their care, they care about is how there are more opportunities for them wantonly corruption. They have nothing to fear, because they know that even if they rape of women in the office doorway, their voters would still support them, because those voters would seriously believe that woman deliberately seduced their politician.
These Latino politicians but also would establish an image in the world as America is Latino America, Latinos are the real masters of the United States. Whites will be in very bad situation. If you want to emigrate, Europe has been very crowded, and there are 25 million Arab Muslims, the Muslims will always remember under white rule in the United States who helped Jews. Canada could be a destination, but it will be very difficult for the Canadian government, because under pressure they must audit white immigrants and latino immigrants equally, otherwise it will be treated as racial discrimination. Measures ultimately adopted across the board, that's all refused. American whites won’t be able to go any place, waiting for the U.S. to become a central America country or Mexico. So my suggestion to all whites, now you go for a trip to Mexico or Guatemala, but do not bring any cash in pocket, because it is not to let you go on vacation, you try to survive there for six months, and then you tell me your experience and new decision on the U.S. immigration policy.
With the decline of the United States, the pattern of the world also will be changed. American leadership will become a big international joke. When the world appears multi-power forces, and they do not mutually recognize each other, it’s the time to begin ringing alarm of new world war.  Britain, France and Germany will again seek dominance in Europe, Germany and Japan would break the restrictions on nuclear weapons, technology and capacity in both countries, they can produce the world's most sophisticated strategic offensive nuclear weapons. Russia will be ready to be tested, to regain regional hegemony. Republics of the former Soviet Union will be very frightened, fearing Russia's annexation, but eventually could not escape to become a vassal state. Arab Muslim extremists will quickly rise and rule the whole Arab world under extremism religious regime, and soon they will acquire nuclear technology and nuclear weapons, Israel will be their proving ground. Israel can only withstand one atomic bomb attack on their small territory, before the country is completely destroyed, they will project out all 160 nuclear weapons. Thus began the end of the world.
When someone asks me if so logical reasoning can explain the progressing of the world situation, my answer is yes. Understand the modern history of Europe, people know that there was no World War I, there would be no World War II, there would be also no international communism of former Soviet Union as well, and all these, were from a car driver getting lost his way. The progressing of human history, sometimes have people sigh.
I therefore call on all Americans, tell your representatives and senators, we must take this action: Revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. we should stop the illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship! Which member of Congress will support this action, she or he is your congresswoman or congressman. Which members of Congress will oppose this action, you should consider an alternative candidate. On the 2016 election, which presidential candidate will propose the so-called immigration reform, you should say no to him or her; Which presidential candidate will sign the Act of cancellation of illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship, you should support his or her election . These days all the occurrence on US-Mexico border has proven these illegal immigrants and their agents in the U.S. political arena echoed in vain, they disregard the interests of united states, constantly squeezing the tolerance of this country, they just want to turn the U.S. into Mexico. This proves once again as I judged before: a person's genes and DNA determine his brain and way of thinking. Latino create mexico, WASP create the United States. some people may feel harsh, but it is a fact. In order to keep U.S. leadership and splendid civilization in the world, in order to prevent the United States to become another Mexico, we have no way to retreat. We not only should prevent the invasion of illegal immigrants, but we have to stop their new born children’s citizenship. only doing so in order to fundamentally solve the problem of illegal immigration. The time is ticking.

708482701.18725.18725,":Just to recap here, policy is that disputed changes — additions or deletions — should not be made to articles without consensus. A group of editors, some with problematic editing histories arrived a few days ago to try to add a paragraph about the Benghazi attacks, leading to protection of the article. The protecting admin noted that no consensus seems to have emerged, so that the material ""should probably be removed"". I did so, citing the talk page discussion and the admin's comments. To try to break the logjam, I tried an approach that has sometimes worked to resolve other content disputes I've seen, adding a carefully written neutral, compromise version of the proposed text that incorporates as much of the disputed version as I could, but sticks to the sources and also matches (in this case copies) from more detailed treatment in other Wikipedia articles. I described this in the edit summary as a ""trial balloon"" that I was floating,  and offered to remove it again if there was no consensus on my wording.

When we combine this with your previous statements in which you said that my motive for adding the information was to negatively impact Hillary Clinton, I believe that it is reasonable to state that you may want to look at your own political biases for a moment before continuing. In addition, I never stated that the attacks were Clinton's fault. All I did was say that she received criticism for them. I think we can all agree that this is true. Whether the criticism is justified or not is for the reader to decide. As for their relevance to the Obama article, they should certainly be discussed in Clinton's biography in greater detail, because they have impacted her more. However, the attacks were made into an issue in the 2012 election, and have since become a major political topic during Obama's second term, and have been used by Republicans in an attempt to discredit the entire administration. I think that all of this worth a few sentences. I support the inclusion of the paragraph with some of the revisions that you suggested, including when you identified the lack of clarity regarding the 2 separate locations of the attacks.

In response to concerns, I typed the words ""Benghazi criticism"" into Google Search. I reached ] article from ABC News as the 5th option. In addition to having the word ""Criticisms"" in the title, it also includes that word or some derivative of it 7 times in the body of the article. What more do you need?
:Nope. This does not stand for the proposition that Obama received substantial criticism, or Clinton either. It reports that in a ""leaked chapter"" of Clinton's now-released book, ''Hard Choices'', she refutes Republican critics vis-a-vis Benghazi. 'Criticism' and 'critic' are different words. Criticism, in the sense used, is an expression of disapproval of somebody or something based on a good faith perception of faults, motives, or mistakes. A critic of someone is not making judgments about whether to approve or disapprove, they are a detractor. This piece, and the great majority of others covering her book chapter, describe this as a reaction to Republican critics, not to widespread disapproval. -

::This is, of course leaving out the apparently unacceptable fox news articles, and any outlet that might have even a small non-left tilt. He has pretty clearly received substantial criticism regarding Benghazi.
:::No, no, and no. Quite likely nothing is going to help because what you are trying to source — that Obama was the subject of criticism over Benghazi, as opposed to partisan political detractors, does not appear to be what the neutral mainstream sources report. If we get past that, or found language describing it like the sources do as a partisan controversy rather than a criticism, we have a weight issue. Is it really biographically significant about the President that this one controversy, among twenty or thirty that his Republican detractors tried to hang on him, became a big deal for them in 2014-2015? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. We don't report all the controversies from earlier news cycles (Ayers, the birthers, etc.) but we do report at least one in passing, resigning from Jeremiah Wright's church, but that one, involving his religious affiliation, does seem more biographical and directly related to him. -

708480448.18693.18693,":Just to recap here, policy is that disputed changes — additions or deletions — should not be made to articles without consensus. A group of editors, some with problematic editing histories (indefinite blocks, multiple blocks for edit warring and personal attacks) arrived a few days ago to try to add a paragraph about the Benghazi attacks, leading to protection of the article. The protecting admin noted that no consensus seems to have emerged, so that the material ""should probably be removed"". I did so, citing the talk page discussion and the admin's comments. To try to break the logjam, I tried an approach that has sometimes worked to resolve other content disputes I've seen, adding a carefully written neutral, compromise version of the proposed text that incorporates as much of the disputed version as I could, but sticks to the sources and also matches (in this case copies) from more detailed treatment in other Wikipedia articles. I described this in the edit summary as a ""trial balloon"" that I was floating,  and offered to remove it again if there was no consensus on my wording. This immediately drew a scolding revert from one of the editors promoting the paragraph. I followed up by removing the section per my earlier comment and the editor went right back to edit warring and posted the insulting screed at the top of this section.

704570208.2.2,"BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. Then what kind of show their politicians will have, I can also tell you now. First, they would further proclaim that they are the masters of this land, whites are immigrants from Europe, for the last few decades whites hinder the immigration issue on the latino, they will ask whites apology, and require constant apology even want an apology written into the Constitution, in order to approve latinos with the naturally born owned rights of the land. WASP created the modern civilization on this primitive land, and instantly turned into second-class citizens and foreign sojourners. Latinos will require a fully representing of the government, for revenge, they will further squeeze out the white forces from various government departments, the easiest way is to open the borders and let 100 million illegal immigrants enter the United States, in short time to obtain a residence permit and the right to vote. Any objections raised by whites, will be deducted racism hat.
After completion of the political siege followed is the economy. They will clearly require Latinos in economic activity must occupy most of proportion, they will use government power to intervene directly, whites will be forced to withdraw and abandon all economic activities. Latino government officials at all levels will use the power in their hands, full penetration into various socio-economic levels. The combination of power and money, then that is a comprehensive social corruption. To get any of the white business survival and development in this society, not by technological innovation, production efficiency and improve service levels, but to rely on bribery of government officials at all levels, and the appropriate government officials get a lot of opportunities for corruption in this way. This is a typical Latin America bureaucratic economy. Under this social environment, WASP wisdom and creativity will disappear, which is what these politicians want: completely destroy any whites’ confidence and the demands of society, in order to consolidate the power base of Latino politicians. As for the collapse of social economy and severe recession, which is not within the scope of their care, they care about is how there are more opportunities for them wantonly corruption. They have nothing to fear, because they know that even if they rape of women in the office doorway, their voters would still support them, because those voters would seriously believe that woman deliberately seduced their politician.
These Latino politicians but also would establish an image in the world as America is Latino America, Latinos are the real masters of the United States. Whites will be in very bad situation. If you want to emigrate, Europe has been very crowded, and there are 25 million Arab Muslims, the Muslims will always remember under white rule in the United States who helped Jews. Canada could be a destination, but it will be very difficult for the Canadian government, because under pressure they must audit white immigrants and latino immigrants equally, otherwise it will be treated as racial discrimination. Measures ultimately adopted across the board, that's all refused. American whites won’t be able to go any place, waiting for the U.S. to become a central America country or Mexico. So my suggestion to all whites, now you go for a trip to Mexico or Guatemala, but do not bring any cash in pocket, because it is not to let you go on vacation, you try to survive there for six months, and then you tell me your experience and new decision on the U.S. immigration policy.
With the decline of the United States, the pattern of the world also will be changed. American leadership will become a big international joke. When the world appears multi-power forces, and they do not mutually recognize each other, it’s the time to begin ringing alarm of new world war.  Britain, France and Germany will again seek dominance in Europe, Germany and Japan would break the restrictions on nuclear weapons, technology and capacity in both countries, they can produce the world's most sophisticated strategic offensive nuclear weapons. Russia will be ready to be tested, to regain regional hegemony. Republics of the former Soviet Union will be very frightened, fearing Russia's annexation, but eventually could not escape to become a vassal state. Arab Muslim extremists will quickly rise and rule the whole Arab world under extremism religious regime, and soon they will acquire nuclear technology and nuclear weapons, Israel will be their proving ground. Israel can only withstand one atomic bomb attack on their small territory, before the country is completely destroyed, they will project out all 160 nuclear weapons. Thus began the end of the world.
When someone asks me if so logical reasoning can explain the progressing of the world situation, my answer is yes. Understand the modern history of Europe, people know that there was no World War I, there would be no World War II, there would be also no international communism of former Soviet Union as well, and all these, were from a car driver getting lost his way. The progressing of human history, sometimes have people sigh.
I therefore call on all Americans, tell your representatives and senators, we must take this action: Revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. we should stop the illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship! Which member of Congress will support this action, she or he is your congresswoman or congressman. Which members of Congress will oppose this action, you should consider an alternative candidate. On the 2016 election, which presidential candidate will propose the so-called immigration reform, you should say no to him or her; Which presidential candidate will sign the Act of cancellation of illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship, you should support his or her election . These days all the occurrence on US-Mexico border has proven these illegal immigrants and their agents in the U.S. political arena echoed in vain, they disregard the interests of united states, constantly squeezing the tolerance of this country, they just want to turn the U.S. into Mexico. This proves once again as I judged before: a person's genes and DNA determine his brain and way of thinking. Latino create mexico, WASP create the United States. some people may feel harsh, but it is a fact. In order to keep U.S. leadership and splendid civilization in the world, in order to prevent the United States to become another Mexico, we have no way to retreat. We not only should prevent the invasion of illegal immigrants, but we have to stop their new born children’s citizenship. only doing so in order to fundamentally solve the problem of illegal immigration. The time is ticking.

== Obama Nobel prize ==
From the article:
Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize was a ""failure""
This suggests that the director of the Nobel Institute feels that Obama is undeserving of the award, while the referenced article actually states that the director expected the honor to deliver a boost to Obama, something he believes did not happen. In other words its a failure of the award to boost Obama, not a failure of Obama as the Wikipedia article seems to suggest. he loves pizza and also boys

703154827.0.1972,"First off, thanks to the editors who crafted a lot of great narrative content, especially the well-rounded lead.
As this page has grown and his presidency has encompassed everything a president does (speeches, policies, elections, and so on), it seems to have lost a good narrative flow. It's unfortunately not the Featured Article it was on the day of his election. Specifically, there's not a particularly cohesive narrative of his presidency. There's a long list of policy views and actions, but not a general history. This leads to a feeling that it's disconnected. I’ll note that [WIKI_LINK: Presidency of Barack Obama] doesn’t have a cohesive narrative either, instead compromising several lists and a bunch of separate policy areas. Work on this page can carry over to that one.
As a model article I will point to [WIKI_LINK: Bill Clinton] (and [WIKI_LINK: Hillary Clinton], although she’s not yet a president). The section on his presidency blends his [WIKI_LINK: United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992#Democratic primary|political story], his [WIKI_LINK: Lewinsky scandal|personal quirks], his [WIKI_LINK: North American Free Trade Agreement|policy achievements] (and [WIKI_LINK: Clinton health care plan of 1993|failures]), his [WIKI_LINK: Economic policy of Bill Clinton|overall effect on the country], and the broader context in which his presidency occurred, in a reasonably easy-to-follow way. The only section dedicated to particular policies (“Military and foreign events”) is a cohesive and roughly chronological account.
What would be great is a '''10+ paragraph walkthrough of the general course of Obama’s presidency''': the ups and downs, the major initiatives ([WIKI_LINK: Obamacare] and [WIKI_LINK: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|rebooting the economy] in particular). Imagine if you want to read for 5 minutes about what he's done. It's not feasible to peruse through a dozen different sections on his energy, Iraq, health care, LGBT, immigration, etc. positions. That would be difficult to follow. The intricate details of his policy achievements are better suited to in-depth articles like [WIKI_LINK: Barack Obama social policy]. Elevating the most notable accomplishments and trimming the others allows this article to stay reasonably-sized and engaging.
The way I think about it is as a biography: when you look back at the overall term, what are the most important bits and what is your general impression? Now condense that into an article for a general audience. The smaller initiatives aren't going to be defining aspects of his legacy. A good biography is going to include a well-balanced account from start to finish, mentioning landmark achievements, his [WIKI_LINK: Social policy of Barack Obama#LGBT issues|biggest thematic priorities] (and [WIKI_LINK: Gun control after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|unsuccessful efforts]), and all the other things swirling around, some of which are out of his control. Important aspects of his meta-presidency include the slow but steady economic growth, continued instability in the Middle East alongside the rise of ISIS, increasing public support for LGBT rights (helping him in 2012), a bigger and more heated focus on race relations, and the loss of Democratic majorities alongside increasingly stark political partisanship (see [WIKI_LINK: Tea Party]). Many of these things are consequences of deeper trends, but he played a role in shaping or responding to each. You can't remove a person from their historical context.
It's also worth addressing the contrast between the campaign ideal of ""Yes We Can"" (political unity and racial solidarity), and the actual history. While we elected an African-American president, we didn't solve our deep-seated racial conundrums. Again, this is not his fault, but it's an important theme to explore.
And it's got to be chronological. A biography doesn't jump from topic to topic in each new chapter.
This is the general idea. I'll work on something but these things are always a collaborative effort.
This is an article [EXTERNAL_LINK: '''tens of millions of people'''] have read or will read and I’m excited to make it better.

708696335.19944.19939,"=== Recap ===
Just to recap here, policy is that disputed changes — additions or deletions — should not be made to articles without consensus. A group of editors, some with problematic editing histories arrived a few days ago to try to add a paragraph about the Benghazi attacks, leading to protection of the article. The protecting admin noted that no consensus seems to have emerged, so that the material ""should probably be removed"". I did so, citing the talk page discussion and the admin's comments. To try to break the logjam, I tried an approach that has sometimes worked to resolve other content disputes I've seen, adding a carefully written neutral, compromise version of the proposed text that incorporates as much of the disputed version as I could, but sticks to the sources and also matches (in this case copies) from more detailed treatment in other Wikipedia articles. I described this in the edit summary as a ""trial balloon"" that I was floating,  and offered to remove it again if there was no consensus on my wording. This immediately drew a scolding revert from one of the editors promoting the paragraph. I followed up by removing the section per my earlier comment and the editor went right back to edit warring and posted the insulting screed at the top of the previous subsection. Bottom line, either we agree on a neutral, acceptable sentence or paragraph to add the Benghazi attacks to the Libya section, or that content stays out until we do. -
::I'm going to assume good faith and guess that the editors are just misguided about content, not paying attention, and/or possibly have a [WIKI_LINK: WP:COMPETENCE] problem. One of the editors has five recent blocks for edit warring and personal attacks and apparently doesn't know [WIKI_LINK: WP:TALK] and thinking it's okay to use, then edit war over, loaded talk page headings.  Another is just off an indef block.). But that's really no good reason to be behaving this way, trying to edit war disputed content on an article. Toning down on the ridiculous accusations and insults would be welcome as well. -

== Obama Nobel prize ==
From the article:
Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize was a ""failure""
This suggests that the director of the Nobel Institute feels that Obama is undeserving of the award, while the referenced article actually states that the director expected the honor to deliver a boost to Obama, something he believes did not happen. In other words its a failure of the award to boost Obama, not a failure of Obama as the Wikipedia article seems to suggest.

In addition to having the word ""Criticisms"" in the title, it also includes that word or some derivative of it 7 times in the body of the article. What more do you need?
:Nope. This does not stand for the proposition that Obama received substantial criticism, or Clinton either. It reports that in a ""leaked chapter"" of Clinton's now-released book, ''Hard Choices'', she refutes Republican critics vis-a-vis Benghazi. 'Criticism' and 'critic' are different words. Criticism, in the sense used, is an expression of disapproval of somebody or something based on a good faith perception of faults, motives, or mistakes. A critic of someone is not making judgments about whether to approve or disapprove, they are a detractor. This piece, and the great majority of others covering her book chapter, describe this as a reaction to Republican critics, not to widespread disapproval. -

::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: CNN - White House under assault over Obamacare, NSA, Benghazi]
::This is, of course leaving out the apparently unacceptable fox news articles, and any outlet that might have even a small non-left tilt. He has pretty clearly received substantial criticism regarding Benghazi.
:::No, no, and no. Quite likely nothing is going to help because what you are trying to source — that Obama was the subject of criticism over Benghazi, as opposed to partisan political detractors, does not appear to be what the neutral mainstream sources report. If we get past that, or found language describing it like the sources do as a partisan controversy rather than a criticism, we have a weight issue. Is it really biographically significant about the President that this one controversy, among twenty or thirty that his Republican detractors tried to hang on him, became a big deal for them in 2014-2015? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. We don't report all the controversies from earlier news cycles (Ayers, the birthers, etc.) but we do report at least one in passing, resigning from Jeremiah Wright's church, but that one, involving his religious affiliation, does seem more biographical and directly related to him. -
::::The simple fact is that there is already a section for Libya. It's entirely appropriate to include the Benghazi attack and the fact that an ambassador was killed. Can we agree on at least that much?
::::As for any criticism or fallout faced by Obama and his cabinet, I'm sure if we add some additional sources, we can agree what should (or shouldn't) be added and how it should be worded. -  ''''
:::The ""small non-left tilt"" jab is cute, but irrelevant. Those sources still state the attacks are from Republicans and there is no mainstream criticism of Obama for a terrorist attack on an Embassy based in Libya. As for edit warring the paragraph into the article and then claiming you need consensus to remove it, that's absurd, and shows that editors have no real understanding of Wiki policy.

703156731.1972.0,"First off, thanks to the editors who crafted a lot of great narrative content, especially the well-rounded lead.
As this page has grown and his presidency has encompassed everything a president does (speeches, policies, elections, and so on), it seems to have lost a good narrative flow. It's unfortunately not the Featured Article it was on the day of his election. Specifically, there's not a particularly cohesive narrative of his presidency. There's a long list of policy views and actions, but not a general history. This leads to a feeling that it's disconnected. I’ll note that [WIKI_LINK: Presidency of Barack Obama] doesn’t have a cohesive narrative either, instead compromising several lists and a bunch of separate policy areas. Work on this page can carry over to that one.
As a model article I will point to [WIKI_LINK: Bill Clinton] (and [WIKI_LINK: Hillary Clinton], although she’s not yet a president). The section on his presidency blends his [WIKI_LINK: United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992#Democratic primary|political story], his [WIKI_LINK: Lewinsky scandal|personal quirks], his [WIKI_LINK: North American Free Trade Agreement|policy achievements] (and [WIKI_LINK: Clinton health care plan of 1993|failures]), his [WIKI_LINK: Economic policy of Bill Clinton|overall effect on the country], and the broader context in which his presidency occurred, in a reasonably easy-to-follow way. The only section dedicated to particular policies (“Military and foreign events”) is a cohesive and roughly chronological account.
What would be great is a '''10+ paragraph walkthrough of the general course of Obama’s presidency''': the ups and downs, the major initiatives ([WIKI_LINK: Obamacare] and [WIKI_LINK: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|rebooting the economy] in particular). Imagine if you want to read for 5 minutes about what he's done. It's not feasible to peruse through a dozen different sections on his energy, Iraq, health care, LGBT, immigration, etc. positions. That would be difficult to follow. The intricate details of his policy achievements are better suited to in-depth articles like [WIKI_LINK: Barack Obama social policy]. Elevating the most notable accomplishments and trimming the others allows this article to stay reasonably-sized and engaging.
The way I think about it is as a biography: when you look back at the overall term, what are the most important bits and what is your general impression? Now condense that into an article for a general audience. The smaller initiatives aren't going to be defining aspects of his legacy. A good biography is going to include a well-balanced account from start to finish, mentioning landmark achievements, his [WIKI_LINK: Social policy of Barack Obama#LGBT issues|biggest thematic priorities] (and [WIKI_LINK: Gun control after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|unsuccessful efforts]), and all the other things swirling around, some of which are out of his control. Important aspects of his meta-presidency include the slow but steady economic growth, continued instability in the Middle East alongside the rise of ISIS, increasing public support for LGBT rights (helping him in 2012), a bigger and more heated focus on race relations, and the loss of Democratic majorities alongside increasingly stark political partisanship (see [WIKI_LINK: Tea Party]). Many of these things are consequences of deeper trends, but he played a role in shaping or responding to each. You can't remove a person from their historical context.
It's also worth addressing the contrast between the campaign ideal of ""Yes We Can"" (political unity and racial solidarity), and the actual history. While we elected an African-American president, we didn't solve our deep-seated racial conundrums. Again, this is not his fault, but it's an important theme to explore.
And it's got to be chronological. A biography doesn't jump from topic to topic in each new chapter.
This is the general idea. I'll work on something but these things are always a collaborative effort.
This is an article [EXTERNAL_LINK: '''tens of millions of people'''] have read or will read and I’m excited to make it better.

The paragraph read;
On September 12, 2012, Islamic militants [WIKI_LINK: 2012 Benghazi attack|attacked] the United States Embassy in [WIKI_LINK: Benghazi]. Four Americans-Ambassador [WIKI_LINK: J. Christopher Stevens], U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer [WIKI_LINK: Sean Smith (diplomat)|Sean Smith], and CIA contractors [WIKI_LINK: Tyrone S.

Cass, Connie. [EXTERNAL_LINK: A summary of various elements of the story of the deaths of 4 Americans at Benghazi, Libya] ''Fox News.'' 12 May 2014. Web. Retrieved 13 February 2016.
It's actually not all that wrong. It could've specified that the ambassador and foreign service officer died at the diplomatic mission and the two CIA contractors died at the nearby CIA outpost. It's absolutely correct that both Obama and Clinton received criticism, though going into detail about who did or did not pay attention to warnings and requests regarding security may not be necessary. That said, this is an event where an ambassador was killed representing the country overseas, both a rare and noteworthy event indeed. -  ''''

I am sure that this has been brought up before, but I still do not understand it? Isn't it as correct to say that he is a white president as it is to say he is an African American. I think this needs to be worded better. Here are a few things I propose:
>the first person of mixed race to hold the office
>the first  half  African American to hold the office
>the first person of both African American and White descent to hold the office
> first person of African American descent
These are all correct. The current statement, to my knowledge, is incorrect, but maybe I am wrong? Correct me if this is the case.

708501956.18784.18784,"=== Edits after page protection lifted ===
Just to recap here, policy is that disputed changes — additions or deletions — should not be made to articles without consensus. A group of editors, some with problematic editing histories arrived a few days ago to try to add a paragraph about the Benghazi attacks, leading to protection of the article. The protecting admin noted that no consensus seems to have emerged, so that the material ""should probably be removed"". I did so, citing the talk page discussion and the admin's comments. To try to break the logjam, I tried an approach that has sometimes worked to resolve other content disputes I've seen, adding a carefully written neutral, compromise version of the proposed text that incorporates as much of the disputed version as I could, but sticks to the sources and also matches (in this case copies) from more detailed treatment in other Wikipedia articles. I described this in the edit summary as a ""trial balloon"" that I was floating,  and offered to remove it again if there was no consensus on my wording. This immediately drew a scolding revert from one of the editors promoting the paragraph. I followed up by removing the section per my earlier comment and the editor went right back to edit warring and posted the insulting screed at the top of this section. Bottom line, either we agree on a neutral, acceptable sentence or paragraph to add the Benghazi attacks to the Libya section, or that content stays out until we do. -
::I'm going to assume good faith and guess that the editors are just misguided about content, not paying attention, and/or possibly have a [WIKI_LINK: WP:COMPETENCE] problem. One of the editors has five recent blocks for edit warring and personal attacks and apparently doesn't know [WIKI_LINK: WP:TALK] and thinking it's okay to use, then edit war over, loaded talk page headings.  Another is just off an indef block.). But that's really no good reason to be behaving this way, trying to edit war disputed content on an article. Toning down on the ridiculous accusations and insults would be welcome as well. -

Please remove the disputed paragraph that was added [EXTERNAL_LINK: here] while the discussion of whether or not to include contentious material continues above.

::I wasn't going to ask for a removal or bug  about protecting the page(without a request), but this answer is both unacceptable and you should not be the one deciding. You protect the page with the contested paragraph still in the article.

That's Wiki policy 101.

705727901.2.2,"BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. Then what kind of show their politicians will have, I can also tell you now. First, they would further proclaim that they are the masters of this land, whites are immigrants from Europe, for the last few decades whites hinder the immigration issue on the latino, they will ask whites apology, and require constant apology even want an apology written into the Constitution, in order to approve latinos with the naturally born owned rights of the land. WASP created the modern civilization on this primitive land, and instantly turned into second-class citizens and foreign sojourners. Latinos will require a fully representing of the government, for revenge, they will further squeeze out the white forces from various government departments, the easiest way is to open the borders and let 100 million illegal immigrants enter the United States, in short time to obtain a residence permit and the right to vote. Any objections raised by whites, will be deducted racism hat.
After completion of the political siege followed is the economy. They will clearly require Latinos in economic activity must occupy most of proportion, they will use government power to intervene directly, whites will be forced to withdraw and abandon all economic activities. Latino government officials at all levels will use the power in their hands, full penetration into various socio-economic levels. The combination of power and money, then that is a comprehensive social corruption. To get any of the white business survival and development in this society, not by technological innovation, production efficiency and improve service levels, but to rely on bribery of government officials at all levels, and the appropriate government officials get a lot of opportunities for corruption in this way. This is a typical Latin America bureaucratic economy. Under this social environment, WASP wisdom and creativity will disappear, which is what these politicians want: completely destroy any whites’ confidence and the demands of society, in order to consolidate the power base of Latino politicians. As for the collapse of social economy and severe recession, which is not within the scope of their care, they care about is how there are more opportunities for them wantonly corruption. They have nothing to fear, because they know that even if they rape of women in the office doorway, their voters would still support them, because those voters would seriously believe that woman deliberately seduced their politician.
These Latino politicians but also would establish an image in the world as America is Latino America, Latinos are the real masters of the United States. Whites will be in very bad situation. If you want to emigrate, Europe has been very crowded, and there are 25 million Arab Muslims, the Muslims will always remember under white rule in the United States who helped Jews. Canada could be a destination, but it will be very difficult for the Canadian government, because under pressure they must audit white immigrants and latino immigrants equally, otherwise it will be treated as racial discrimination. Measures ultimately adopted across the board, that's all refused. American whites won’t be able to go any place, waiting for the U.S. to become a central America country or Mexico. So my suggestion to all whites, now you go for a trip to Mexico or Guatemala, but do not bring any cash in pocket, because it is not to let you go on vacation, you try to survive there for six months, and then you tell me your experience and new decision on the U.S. immigration policy.
With the decline of the United States, the pattern of the world also will be changed. American leadership will become a big international joke. When the world appears multi-power forces, and they do not mutually recognize each other, it’s the time to begin ringing alarm of new world war.  Britain, France and Germany will again seek dominance in Europe, Germany and Japan would break the restrictions on nuclear weapons, technology and capacity in both countries, they can produce the world's most sophisticated strategic offensive nuclear weapons. Russia will be ready to be tested, to regain regional hegemony. Republics of the former Soviet Union will be very frightened, fearing Russia's annexation, but eventually could not escape to become a vassal state. Arab Muslim extremists will quickly rise and rule the whole Arab world under extremism religious regime, and soon they will acquire nuclear technology and nuclear weapons, Israel will be their proving ground. Israel can only withstand one atomic bomb attack on their small territory, before the country is completely destroyed, they will project out all 160 nuclear weapons. Thus began the end of the world.
When someone asks me if so logical reasoning can explain the progressing of the world situation, my answer is yes. Understand the modern history of Europe, people know that there was no World War I, there would be no World War II, there would be also no international communism of former Soviet Union as well, and all these, were from a car driver getting lost his way. The progressing of human history, sometimes have people sigh.
I therefore call on all Americans, tell your representatives and senators, we must take this action: Revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. we should stop the illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship! Which member of Congress will support this action, she or he is your congresswoman or congressman. Which members of Congress will oppose this action, you should consider an alternative candidate. On the 2016 election, which presidential candidate will propose the so-called immigration reform, you should say no to him or her; Which presidential candidate will sign the Act of cancellation of illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship, you should support his or her election . These days all the occurrence on US-Mexico border has proven these illegal immigrants and their agents in the U.S. political arena echoed in vain, they disregard the interests of united states, constantly squeezing the tolerance of this country, they just want to turn the U.S. into Mexico. This proves once again as I judged before: a person's genes and DNA determine his brain and way of thinking. Latino create mexico, WASP create the United States. some people may feel harsh, but it is a fact. In order to keep U.S. leadership and splendid civilization in the world, in order to prevent the United States to become another Mexico, we have no way to retreat. We not only should prevent the invasion of illegal immigrants, but we have to stop their new born children’s citizenship. only doing so in order to fundamentally solve the problem of illegal immigration.

In addition to having the word ""Criticisms"" in the title, it also includes that word or some derivative of it 7 times in the body of the article. What more do you need?
:Nope. This does not stand for the proposition that Obama received substantial criticism, or Clinton either. It reports that in a ""leaked chapter"" of Clinton's now-released book, ''Hard Choices'', she refutes Republican critics vis-a-vis Benghazi. 'Criticism' and 'critic' are different words. Criticism, in the sense used, is an expression of disapproval of somebody or something based on a good faith perception of faults, motives, or mistakes. A critic of someone is not making judgments about whether to approve or disapprove, they are a detractor. This piece, and the great majority of others covering her book chapter, describe this as a reaction to Republican critics, not to widespread disapproval. -

If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. Then what kind of show their politicians will have, I can also tell you now. First, they would further proclaim that they are the masters of this land, whites are immigrants from Europe, for the last few decades whites hinder the immigration issue on the latino, they will ask whites apology, and require constant apology even want an apology written into the Constitution, in order to approve latinos with the naturally born owned rights of the land. WASP created the modern civilization on this primitive land, and instantly turned into second-class citizens and foreign sojourners. Latinos will require a fully representing of the government, for revenge, they will further squeeze out the white forces from various government departments, the easiest way is to open the borders and let 100 million illegal immigrants enter the United States, in short time to obtain a residence permit and the right to vote. Any objections raised by whites, will be deducted racism hat.
After completion of the political siege followed is the economy. They will clearly require Latinos in economic activity must occupy most of proportion, they will use government power to intervene directly, whites will be forced to withdraw and abandon all economic activities. Latino government officials at all levels will use the power in their hands, full penetration into various socio-economic levels. The combination of power and money, then that is a comprehensive social corruption. To get any of the white business survival and development in this society, not by technological innovation, production efficiency and improve service levels, but to rely on bribery of government officials at all levels, and the appropriate government officials get a lot of opportunities for corruption in this way. This is a typical Latin America bureaucratic economy. Under this social environment, WASP wisdom and creativity will disappear, which is what these politicians want: completely destroy any whites’ confidence and the demands of society, in order to consolidate the power base of Latino politicians. As for the collapse of social economy and severe recession, which is not within the scope of their care, they care about is how there are more opportunities for them wantonly corruption. They have nothing to fear, because they know that even if they rape of women in the office doorway, their voters would still support them, because those voters would seriously believe that woman deliberately seduced their politician.
These Latino politicians but also would establish an image in the world as America is Latino America, Latinos are the real masters of the United States. Whites will be in very bad situation. If you want to emigrate, Europe has been very crowded, and there are 25 million Arab Muslims, the Muslims will always remember under white rule in the United States who helped Jews. Canada could be a destination, but it will be very difficult for the Canadian government, because under pressure they must audit white immigrants and latino immigrants equally, otherwise it will be treated as racial discrimination. Measures ultimately adopted across the board, that's all refused. American whites won’t be able to go any place, waiting for the U.S. to become a central America country or Mexico. So my suggestion to all whites, now you go for a trip to Mexico or Guatemala, but do not bring any cash in pocket, because it is not to let you go on vacation, you try to survive there for six months, and then you tell me your experience and new decision on the U.S. immigration policy.
With the decline of the United States, the pattern of the world also will be changed. American leadership will become a big international joke. When the world appears multi-power forces, and they do not mutually recognize each other, it’s the time to begin ringing alarm of new world war.  Britain, France and Germany will again seek dominance in Europe, Germany and Japan would break the restrictions on nuclear weapons, technology and capacity in both countries, they can produce the world's most sophisticated strategic offensive nuclear weapons. Russia will be ready to be tested, to regain regional hegemony. Republics of the former Soviet Union will be very frightened, fearing Russia's annexation, but eventually could not escape to become a vassal state. Arab Muslim extremists will quickly rise and rule the whole Arab world under extremism religious regime, and soon they will acquire nuclear technology and nuclear weapons, Israel will be their proving ground. Israel can only withstand one atomic bomb attack on their small territory, before the country is completely destroyed, they will project out all 160 nuclear weapons. Thus began the end of the world.
When someone asks me if so logical reasoning can explain the progressing of the world situation, my answer is yes. Understand the modern history of Europe, people know that there was no World War I, there would be no World War II, there would be also no international communism of former Soviet Union as well, and all these, were from a car driver getting lost his way. The progressing of human history, sometimes have people sigh.
I therefore call on all Americans, tell your representatives and senators, we must take this action: Revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. we should stop the illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship! Which member of Congress will support this action, she or he is your congresswoman or congressman. Which members of Congress will oppose this action, you should consider an alternative candidate. On the 2016 election, which presidential candidate will propose the so-called immigration reform, you should say no to him or her; Which presidential candidate will sign the Act of cancellation of illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship, you should support his or her election . These days all the occurrence on US-Mexico border has proven these illegal immigrants and their agents in the U.S. political arena echoed in vain, they disregard the interests of united states, constantly squeezing the tolerance of this country, they just want to turn the U.S. into Mexico. This proves once again as I judged before: a person's genes and DNA determine his brain and way of thinking. Latino create mexico, WASP create the United States. some people may feel harsh, but it is a fact. In order to keep U.S. leadership and splendid civilization in the world, in order to prevent the United States to become another Mexico, we have no way to retreat. We not only should prevent the invasion of illegal immigrants, but we have to stop their new born children’s citizenship. only doing so in order to fundamentally solve the problem of illegal immigration. The time is ticking.  — Preceding [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned] comment added by

African American is an ethnic group exclusive to the United States that is made up of the descendants of African slaves brought across the Atlantic from West Africa during the Transatlantic Slave Trade, which lasted from the 16th to the 19th century. Though African Americans and President Obama both share African ancestry, African Americans alive today trace their ancestry back at least 100 years, while President Obama traces his ancestry back with his father.

Therefore, I do not think that it is appropriate for you to make the comments that you did here by saying that the attacks were not her responsibility. That is your personal opinion on what is still a very controversial political topic. When we combine this with your previous statements in which you said that my motive for adding the information was to negatively impact Hillary Clinton, I believe that it is reasonable to state that you may want to look at your own political biases for a moment before continuing. (The same goes for your statement on Fox News.) In addition, I never stated that the attacks were Clinton's fault. All I did was say that she received criticism for them. I think we can all agree that this is true. Whether the criticism is justified or not is for the reader to decide. As for their relevance to the Obama article, they should certainly be discussed in Clinton's biography in greater detail, because they have impacted her more. However, the attacks were made into an issue in the 2012 election, and have since become a major political topic during Obama's second term, and have been used by Republicans in an attempt to discredit the entire administration. I think that all of this worth a few sentences. I support the inclusion of the paragraph with some of the revisions that you suggested, including when you identified the lack of clarity regarding the 2 separate locations of the attacks.

I am sure that this has been brought up before, but I still do not understand it? Isn't it as correct to say that he is a white president as it is to say he is an African American. I think this needs to be worded better. Here are a few things I propose:
>the first person of mixed race to hold the office
>the first  half  African American to hold the office
>the first person of both African American and White descent to hold the office

Just to recap here, policy is that disputed changes — additions or deletions — should not be made to articles without consensus.

The protecting admin noted that no consensus seems to have emerged, so that the material ""should probably be removed"". I did so, citing the talk page discussion and the admin's comments. To try to break the logjam, I tried an approach that has sometimes worked to resolve other content disputes I've seen, adding a carefully written neutral, compromise version of the proposed text that incorporates as much of the disputed version as I could, but sticks to the sources and also matches (in this case copies) from more detailed treatment in other Wikipedia articles. I described this in the edit summary as a ""trial balloon"" that I was floating,  and offered to remove it again if there was no consensus on my wording. This immediately drew a scolding revert from one of the editors promoting the paragraph. I followed up by removing the section per my earlier comment and the editor went right back to edit warring and posted the insulting screed at the top of the previous subsection. Bottom line, either we agree on a neutral, acceptable sentence or paragraph to add the Benghazi attacks to the Libya section, or that content stays out until we do. -

I followed up by removing the section per my earlier comment and the editor went right back to edit warring and posted the insulting screed at the top of this section. Bottom line, either we agree on a neutral, acceptable sentence or paragraph to add the Benghazi attacks to the Libya section, or that content stays out until we do. -

In addition to having the word ""Criticisms"" in the title, it also includes that word or some derivative of it 7 times in the body of the article. What more do you need?
:Nope. This does not stand for the proposition that Obama received substantial criticism, or Clinton either. It reports that in a ""leaked chapter"" of Clinton's now-released book, ''Hard Choices'', she refutes Republican critics vis-a-vis Benghazi. 'Criticism' and 'critic' are different words. Criticism, in the sense used, is an expression of disapproval of somebody or something based on a good faith perception of faults, motives, or mistakes. A critic of someone is not making judgments about whether to approve or disapprove, they are a detractor. This piece, and the great majority of others covering her book chapter, describe this as a reaction to Republican critics, not to widespread disapproval. -

::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: CNN - White House under assault over Obamacare, NSA, Benghazi]
::This is, of course leaving out the apparently unacceptable fox news articles, and any outlet that might have even a small non-left tilt. He has pretty clearly received substantial criticism regarding Benghazi.
:::No, no, and no. Quite likely nothing is going to help because what you are trying to source — that Obama was the subject of criticism over Benghazi, as opposed to partisan political detractors, does not appear to be what the neutral mainstream sources report. If we get past that, or found language describing it like the sources do as a partisan controversy rather than a criticism, we have a weight issue. Is it really biographically significant about the President that this one controversy, among twenty or thirty that his Republican detractors tried to hang on him, became a big deal for them in 2014-2015? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. We don't report all the controversies from earlier news cycles (Ayers, the birthers, etc.) but we do report at least one in passing, resigning from Jeremiah Wright's church, but that one, involving his religious affiliation, does seem more biographical and directly related to him. -
::::The simple fact is that there is already a section for Libya. It's entirely appropriate to include the Benghazi attack and the fact that an ambassador was killed. Can we agree on at least that much?
::::As for any criticism or fallout faced by Obama and his cabinet, I'm sure if we add some additional sources, we can agree what should (or shouldn't) be added and how it should be worded. -  ''''
:::The ""small non-left tilt"" jab is cute, but irrelevant. Those sources still state the attacks are from Republicans and there is no mainstream criticism of Obama for a terrorist attack on an Embassy based in Libya. As for edit warring the paragraph into the article and then claiming you need consensus to remove it, that's absurd, and shows that editors have no real understanding of Wiki policy.
::::So, just because it's from Republicans means the criticism is both invalid, and non-mainstream - if I'm interpreting your comment correctly? I've been around for about 10 years, I'm not a new editor.
:::::, you have claimed that these ""criticisms"" are not what ""neutral mainstream sources"" report upon. One of the articles cited by  came from CNN. CNN and Fox are both mainstream sources. Fox is often considered slightly right-leaning, while CNN is often considered slightly left-leaning, although they are both neutral enough to generally be considered mainstream. ""Criticism"" is a totally accurate word, and can be used to describe those who claim that Clinton and Obama did not adequately prepare for or deal with the crisis. , I believe that  is absolutely right. Articles report upon comments and criticism from all fronts. Regarding your edit warring comments, Wikipedia policy clearly states that it takes two to edit war. You cannot blame it all on a different group of editors simply because they disagree with you. With this statement, as well as various attempts to inject your own political philosophy into the article, I now question your understanding of Wikipedia policy. I would now like to pose a question to everyone. '''At what point in the article is it stated that Obama and Clinton are responsible for what happened in Benghazi?'''

704569891.14.14,"BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. Then what kind of show their politicians will have, I can also tell you now. First, they would further proclaim that they are the masters of this land, whites are immigrants from Europe, for the last few decades whites hinder the immigration issue on the latino, they will ask whites apology, and require constant apology even want an apology written into the Constitution, in order to approve latinos with the naturally born owned rights of the land. WASP created the modern civilization on this primitive land, and instantly turned into second-class citizens and foreign sojourners. Latinos will require a fully representing of the government, for revenge, they will further squeeze out the white forces from various government departments, the easiest way is to open the borders and let 100 million illegal immigrants enter the United States, in short time to obtain a residence permit and the right to vote. Any objections raised by whites, will be deducted racism hat.
After completion of the political siege followed is the economy. They will clearly require Latinos in economic activity must occupy most of proportion, they will use government power to intervene directly, whites will be forced to withdraw and abandon all economic activities. Latino government officials at all levels will use the power in their hands, full penetration into various socio-economic levels. The combination of power and money, then that is a comprehensive social corruption. To get any of the white business survival and development in this society, not by technological innovation, production efficiency and improve service levels, but to rely on bribery of government officials at all levels, and the appropriate government officials get a lot of opportunities for corruption in this way. This is a typical Latin America bureaucratic economy. Under this social environment, WASP wisdom and creativity will disappear, which is what these politicians want: completely destroy any whites’ confidence and the demands of society, in order to consolidate the power base of Latino politicians. As for the collapse of social economy and severe recession, which is not within the scope of their care, they care about is how there are more opportunities for them wantonly corruption. They have nothing to fear, because they know that even if they rape of women in the office doorway, their voters would still support them, because those voters would seriously believe that woman deliberately seduced their politician.
These Latino politicians but also would establish an image in the world as America is Latino America, Latinos are the real masters of the United States. Whites will be in very bad situation. If you want to emigrate, Europe has been very crowded, and there are 25 million Arab Muslims, the Muslims will always remember under white rule in the United States who helped Jews. Canada could be a destination, but it will be very difficult for the Canadian government, because under pressure they must audit white immigrants and latino immigrants equally, otherwise it will be treated as racial discrimination. Measures ultimately adopted across the board, that's all refused. American whites won’t be able to go any place, waiting for the U.S. to become a central America country or Mexico. So my suggestion to all whites, now you go for a trip to Mexico or Guatemala, but do not bring any cash in pocket, because it is not to let you go on vacation, you try to survive there for six months, and then you tell me your experience and new decision on the U.S. immigration policy.
With the decline of the United States, the pattern of the world also will be changed. American leadership will become a big international joke. When the world appears multi-power forces, and they do not mutually recognize each other, it’s the time to begin ringing alarm of new world war.  Britain, France and Germany will again seek dominance in Europe, Germany and Japan would break the restrictions on nuclear weapons, technology and capacity in both countries, they can produce the world's most sophisticated strategic offensive nuclear weapons. Russia will be ready to be tested, to regain regional hegemony. Republics of the former Soviet Union will be very frightened, fearing Russia's annexation, but eventually could not escape to become a vassal state. Arab Muslim extremists will quickly rise and rule the whole Arab world under extremism religious regime, and soon they will acquire nuclear technology and nuclear weapons, Israel will be their proving ground. Israel can only withstand one atomic bomb attack on their small territory, before the country is completely destroyed, they will project out all 160 nuclear weapons. Thus began the end of the world.
When someone asks me if so logical reasoning can explain the progressing of the world situation, my answer is yes. Understand the modern history of Europe, people know that there was no World War I, there would be no World War II, there would be also no international communism of former Soviet Union as well, and all these, were from a car driver getting lost his way. The progressing of human history, sometimes have people sigh.
I therefore call on all Americans, tell your representatives and senators, we must take this action: Revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. we should stop the illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship! Which member of Congress will support this action, she or he is your congresswoman or congressman. Which members of Congress will oppose this action, you should consider an alternative candidate. On the 2016 election, which presidential candidate will propose the so-called immigration reform, you should say no to him or her; Which presidential candidate will sign the Act of cancellation of illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship, you should support his or her election . These days all the occurrence on US-Mexico border has proven these illegal immigrants and their agents in the U.S. political arena echoed in vain, they disregard the interests of united states, constantly squeezing the tolerance of this country, they just want to turn the U.S. into Mexico.

Please remove the disputed paragraph that was added [EXTERNAL_LINK: here] while the discussion of whether or not to include contentious material continues above. In its current form, it does not represent a fair summary of the political and biographical ramifications of the [WIKI_LINK: 2012 Benghazi attack] as it pertains to the subject of this article. Moreover, in what arguably can be considered a violation of [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], it makes allegations about former Secretary Hillary Clinton (who is not the subject of this article) and does so with a dated source of dubious quality. A fuller justification can be found in an earlier section of this talkpage.

::[REPLY_TO: MSGJ] - Can you make the small correction, as noted above? Right now there is a factual error, but simply removing the words ""Four Americans;"" from the beginning of the second sentence will resolve it for now. I wouldn't think that anyone would have a problem with this. Hopefully in the coming days we can get some more people involved, have a productive discussion and come to a consensus on how to proceed with this paragraph. -  ''''
::I wasn't going to ask for a removal or bug  about protecting the page(without a request), but this answer is both unacceptable and you should not be the one deciding. You protect the page with the contested paragraph still in the article. If editors challenge an addition to the article, it's incumbent upon the editors who want the information placed into the article to achieve consensus to add it into the article, not the editors who do not want the edit placed into the article. That's Wiki policy 101.
:::That's generally correct, but with all the to and fro I can't actually determine what the ""status quo"" is. The diff supplied by Scjessey is certainly not the first insertion of this paragraph. That said, if we can get a rough consensus for removal I will do so. — Martin ( ·
::::Still though, that is kind of backwards. The consensus should be achieved before it is added, not to remove contested material in a BLP. It was first added [EXTERNAL_LINK: here], the version before it was added is [EXTERNAL_LINK: here]. My problems with the edit are listed [EXTERNAL_LINK: here]. I do not think the article should include the edit until it is discussed and the problems are addressed, but I am will to say consensus is against me after a time, if that is the case. But it should not be edit warred into the article and have the page protected to make it impossible to remove. Thanks.
:::::It seems it was added earlier than this, sometime in February, so that is not the first time is was inserted. I can only point you towards [WIKI_LINK: meta:The Wrong Version|The Wrong Version]. Continue to discuss and if there is consensus to remove I'll do so forthwith. It's nothing so horrendous that it can't stay for a few hours. — Martin ( ·
::::::In the meantime, the small correction? -  ''''
:::::::I've no issue with the correction. I'm involved or I'd make the change myself.
::::::::This minor correction will do fine.
:It should be removed — if not immediately, then as soon as protection expires. This kind of editing in partisan political material is terribly inappropriate, both in substance and editing process. -
::How is it ""partisan""...? -  ''''
:::The accusations against the President and Secretary of State, members of one political party, were made more or less exclusively by operatives of the opposing party for political purposes. That's the definition of partisan, on one side or another of a political division. -
::::Wait, whom precisely are you accusing of being operatives of what, exactly?
:::::Whom = politicians and pundits accusing Obama and Clinton of misdeeds and failures relating to the Benghazi attacks; what = United States Republican Party. It's pretty basic. -
:::::Right, what Wikidemon said. As should be obvious. And as I've outlined in a minor way above. Which discussion was ended by protecting the page with the edit included in the article. And the page was protected not for 24 hours, but for 48 hours.

In response to concerns, I typed the words ""Benghazi criticism"" into Google Search. I reached ] article from ABC News as the 5th option. In addition to having the word ""Criticisms"" in the title, it also includes that word or some derivative of it 7 times in the body of the article. What more do you need?
:Nope. This does not stand for the proposition that Obama received substantial criticism, or Clinton either. It reports that in a ""leaked chapter"" of Clinton's now-released book, ''Hard Choices'', she refutes Republican critics vis-a-vis Benghazi. 'Criticism' and 'critic' are different words. Criticism, in the sense used, is an expression of disapproval of somebody or something based on a good faith perception of faults, motives, or mistakes. A critic of someone is not making judgments about whether to approve or disapprove, they are a detractor. This piece, and the great majority of others covering her book chapter, describe this as a reaction to Republican critics, not to widespread disapproval. -

::Seriously - what's it going to take? Here's a short list mentioning response to Obama being criticized over Benghazi.
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: LA Times - U.S. officials counter criticism in Benghazi attack]
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: NPR - After Benghazi Hearings, Flurry Of Concern Unsettled]
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: CNN - White House under assault over Obamacare, NSA, Benghazi]
::This is, of course leaving out the apparently unacceptable fox news articles, and any outlet that might have even a small non-left tilt. He has pretty clearly received substantial criticism regarding Benghazi.
:::No, no, and no. Quite likely nothing is going to help because what you are trying to source — that Obama was the subject of criticism over Benghazi, as opposed to partisan political detractors, does not appear to be what the neutral mainstream sources report. If we get past that, or found language describing it like the sources do as a partisan controversy rather than a criticism, we have a weight issue. Is it really biographically significant about the President that this one controversy, among twenty or thirty that his Republican detractors tried to hang on him, became a big deal for them in 2014-2015? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. We don't report all the controversies from earlier news cycles (Ayers, the birthers, etc.) but we do report at least one in passing, resigning from Jeremiah Wright's church, but that one, involving his religious affiliation, does seem more biographical and directly related to him. -
::::The simple fact is that there is already a section for Libya. It's entirely appropriate to include the Benghazi attack and the fact that an ambassador was killed. Can we agree on at least that much?
::::As for any criticism or fallout faced by Obama and his cabinet, I'm sure if we add some additional sources, we can agree what should (or shouldn't) be added and how it should be worded. -  ''''
:::The ""small non-left tilt"" jab is cute, but irrelevant. Those sources still state the attacks are from Republicans and there is no mainstream criticism of Obama for a terrorist attack on an Embassy based in Libya. As for edit warring the paragraph into the article and then claiming you need consensus to remove it, that's absurd, and shows that editors have no real understanding of Wiki policy.
::::So, just because it's from Republicans means the criticism is both invalid, and non-mainstream - if I'm interpreting your comment correctly? I've been around for about 10 years, I'm not a new editor.
:::::, you have claimed that these ""criticisms"" are not what ""neutral mainstream sources"" report upon. One of the articles cited by  came from CNN. CNN and Fox are both mainstream sources. Fox is often considered slightly right-leaning, while CNN is often considered slightly left-leaning, although they are both neutral enough to generally be considered mainstream. ""Criticism"" is a totally accurate word, and can be used to describe those who claim that Clinton and Obama did not adequately prepare for or deal with the crisis. , I believe that  is absolutely right. Articles report upon comments and criticism from all fronts. Regarding your edit warring comments, Wikipedia policy clearly states that it takes two to edit war. You cannot blame it all on a different group of editors simply because they disagree with you. With this statement, as well as various attempts to inject your own political philosophy into the article, I now question your understanding of Wikipedia policy. I would now like to pose a question to everyone. '''At what point in the article is it stated that Obama and Clinton are responsible for what happened in Benghazi?'''

701011053.3282.3268,"First off, thanks to the editors who crafted a lot of great narrative content, especially the well-rounded lead.
As this page has grown and his presidency has encompassed everything a president does (speeches, policies, elections, and so on), it seems to have lost a good narrative flow. It's unfortunately not the Featured Article it was on the day of his election. Specifically, there's not a particularly cohesive narrative of his presidency. There's a long list of policy views and actions, but not a general history. This leads to a feeling that it's disconnected. I’ll note that [WIKI_LINK: Presidency of Barack Obama] doesn’t have a cohesive narrative either, instead compromising several lists and a bunch of separate policy areas. Work on this page can carry over to that one.
As a model article I will point to [WIKI_LINK: Bill Clinton] (and [WIKI_LINK: Hillary Clinton], although she’s not yet a president). The section on his presidency blends his [WIKI_LINK: United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992#Democratic primary|political story], his [WIKI_LINK: Lewinsky scandal|personal quirks], his [WIKI_LINK: North American Free Trade Agreement|policy achievements] (and [WIKI_LINK: Clinton health care plan of 1993|failures]), his [WIKI_LINK: Economic policy of Bill Clinton|overall effect on the country], and the broader context in which his presidency occurred, in a reasonably easy-to-follow way. The only section dedicated to particular policies (“Military and foreign events”) is a cohesive and roughly chronological account.
What would be great is a '''10+ paragraph walkthrough of the general course of Obama’s presidency''': the ups and downs, the major initiatives ([WIKI_LINK: Obamacare] and [WIKI_LINK: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|rebooting the economy] in particular). Imagine if you want to read for 5 minutes about what he's done. It's not feasible to peruse through a dozen different sections on his energy, Iraq, health care, LGBT, immigration, etc. positions. That would be difficult to follow. The intricate details of his policy achievements are better suited to in-depth articles like [WIKI_LINK: Barack Obama social policy]. Elevating the most notable accomplishments and trimming the others allows this article to stay reasonably-sized and engaging.
The way I think about it is as a biography: when you look back at the overall term, what are the most important bits and what is your general impression? Now condense that into an article for a general audience. The smaller initiatives aren't going to be defining aspects of his legacy. A good biography is going to include a well-balanced account from start to finish, mentioning landmark achievements, his [WIKI_LINK: Social policy of Barack Obama#LGBT issues|biggest thematic priorities] (and [WIKI_LINK: Gun control after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|unsuccessful efforts]), and all the other things swirling around, some of which are out of his control. Important aspects of his meta-presidency include the slow but steady economic growth, continued instability in the Middle East alongside the rise of ISIS, increasing public support for LGBT rights (helping him in 2012), a bigger and more heated focus on race relations, and the loss of Democratic majorities alongside increasingly stark political partisanship (see [WIKI_LINK: Tea Party]). Many of these things are consequences of deeper trends, but he played a role in shaping or responding to each. You can't remove a person from their historical context.
It's also worth addressing the contrast between the campaign ideal of ""Yes We Can"" (political unity and racial solidarity), and the actual history. While we elected an African-American president, we didn't solve our deep-seated racial conundrums. Again, this is not his fault, but it's an important theme to explore.
And it's got to be chronological. A biography doesn't jump from topic to topic in each new chapter.
This is the general idea. I'll work on something but these things are always a collaborative effort.
This is an article [EXTERNAL_LINK: '''tens of millions of people'''] have read or will read and I’m excited to make it better.

Stating otherwise would violate [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP]. Third, the paragraph wasn't written neutrally, since in addition to blaming Clinton for something that wasn't her responsibility, it also failed to mention that a Republican Congress refused to fund asked-for security upgrades at the embassy.

708481314.18693.18693,":Just to recap here, policy is that disputed changes — additions or deletions — should not be made to articles without consensus. A group of editors, some with problematic editing histories (one with five recent blocks for edit warring and personal attacks, another just off an indef block) arrived a few days ago to try to add a paragraph about the Benghazi attacks, leading to protection of the article. The protecting admin noted that no consensus seems to have emerged, so that the material ""should probably be removed"". I did so, citing the talk page discussion and the admin's comments. To try to break the logjam, I tried an approach that has sometimes worked to resolve other content disputes I've seen, adding a carefully written neutral, compromise version of the proposed text that incorporates as much of the disputed version as I could, but sticks to the sources and also matches (in this case copies) from more detailed treatment in other Wikipedia articles. I described this in the edit summary as a ""trial balloon"" that I was floating,  and offered to remove it again if there was no consensus on my wording. This immediately drew a scolding revert from one of the editors promoting the paragraph. I followed up by removing the section per my earlier comment and the editor went right back to edit warring and posted the insulting screed at the top of this section. I'm going to assume good faith and guess that the editor is just misguided about content, not paying attention, and possibly has a [WIKI_LINK: WP:COMPETENCE] problem, but that's really no good reason to be behaving this way. Either we agree on a neutral, acceptable sentence or paragraph to add the Benghazi attacks to the Libya section, or that content stays out until we do.

:::No, no, and no. Quite likely nothing is going to help because what you are trying to source — that Obama was the subject of criticism over Benghazi, as opposed to partisan political detractors, does not appear to be what the neutral mainstream sources report. If we get past that, or found language describing it like the sources do as a partisan controversy rather than a criticism, we have a weight issue. Is it really biographically significant about the President that this one controversy, among twenty or thirty that his Republican detractors tried to hang on him, became a big deal for them in 2014-2015? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. We don't report all the controversies from earlier news cycles (Ayers, the birthers, etc.) but we do report at least one in passing, resigning from Jeremiah Wright's church, but that one, involving his religious affiliation, does seem more biographical and directly related to him. -

704570225.2.2,"BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. Then what kind of show their politicians will have, I can also tell you now. First, they would further proclaim that they are the masters of this land, whites are immigrants from Europe, for the last few decades whites hinder the immigration issue on the latino, they will ask whites apology, and require constant apology even want an apology written into the Constitution, in order to approve latinos with the naturally born owned rights of the land. WASP created the modern civilization on this primitive land, and instantly turned into second-class citizens and foreign sojourners. Latinos will require a fully representing of the government, for revenge, they will further squeeze out the white forces from various government departments, the easiest way is to open the borders and let 100 million illegal immigrants enter the United States, in short time to obtain a residence permit and the right to vote. Any objections raised by whites, will be deducted racism hat.
After completion of the political siege followed is the economy. They will clearly require Latinos in economic activity must occupy most of proportion, they will use government power to intervene directly, whites will be forced to withdraw and abandon all economic activities. Latino government officials at all levels will use the power in their hands, full penetration into various socio-economic levels. The combination of power and money, then that is a comprehensive social corruption. To get any of the white business survival and development in this society, not by technological innovation, production efficiency and improve service levels, but to rely on bribery of government officials at all levels, and the appropriate government officials get a lot of opportunities for corruption in this way. This is a typical Latin America bureaucratic economy. Under this social environment, WASP wisdom and creativity will disappear, which is what these politicians want: completely destroy any whites’ confidence and the demands of society, in order to consolidate the power base of Latino politicians. As for the collapse of social economy and severe recession, which is not within the scope of their care, they care about is how there are more opportunities for them wantonly corruption. They have nothing to fear, because they know that even if they rape of women in the office doorway, their voters would still support them, because those voters would seriously believe that woman deliberately seduced their politician.
These Latino politicians but also would establish an image in the world as America is Latino America, Latinos are the real masters of the United States. Whites will be in very bad situation. If you want to emigrate, Europe has been very crowded, and there are 25 million Arab Muslims, the Muslims will always remember under white rule in the United States who helped Jews. Canada could be a destination, but it will be very difficult for the Canadian government, because under pressure they must audit white immigrants and latino immigrants equally, otherwise it will be treated as racial discrimination. Measures ultimately adopted across the board, that's all refused. American whites won’t be able to go any place, waiting for the U.S. to become a central America country or Mexico. So my suggestion to all whites, now you go for a trip to Mexico or Guatemala, but do not bring any cash in pocket, because it is not to let you go on vacation, you try to survive there for six months, and then you tell me your experience and new decision on the U.S. immigration policy.
With the decline of the United States, the pattern of the world also will be changed. American leadership will become a big international joke. When the world appears multi-power forces, and they do not mutually recognize each other, it’s the time to begin ringing alarm of new world war.  Britain, France and Germany will again seek dominance in Europe, Germany and Japan would break the restrictions on nuclear weapons, technology and capacity in both countries, they can produce the world's most sophisticated strategic offensive nuclear weapons. Russia will be ready to be tested, to regain regional hegemony. Republics of the former Soviet Union will be very frightened, fearing Russia's annexation, but eventually could not escape to become a vassal state. Arab Muslim extremists will quickly rise and rule the whole Arab world under extremism religious regime, and soon they will acquire nuclear technology and nuclear weapons, Israel will be their proving ground. Israel can only withstand one atomic bomb attack on their small territory, before the country is completely destroyed, they will project out all 160 nuclear weapons. Thus began the end of the world.
When someone asks me if so logical reasoning can explain the progressing of the world situation, my answer is yes. Understand the modern history of Europe, people know that there was no World War I, there would be no World War II, there would be also no international communism of former Soviet Union as well, and all these, were from a car driver getting lost his way. The progressing of human history, sometimes have people sigh.
I therefore call on all Americans, tell your representatives and senators, we must take this action: Revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. we should stop the illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship! Which member of Congress will support this action, she or he is your congresswoman or congressman. Which members of Congress will oppose this action, you should consider an alternative candidate. On the 2016 election, which presidential candidate will propose the so-called immigration reform, you should say no to him or her; Which presidential candidate will sign the Act of cancellation of illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship, you should support his or her election . These days all the occurrence on US-Mexico border has proven these illegal immigrants and their agents in the U.S. political arena echoed in vain, they disregard the interests of united states, constantly squeezing the tolerance of this country, they just want to turn the U.S. into Mexico. This proves once again as I judged before: a person's genes and DNA determine his brain and way of thinking. Latino create mexico, WASP create the United States. some people may feel harsh, but it is a fact. In order to keep U.S. leadership and splendid civilization in the world, in order to prevent the United States to become another Mexico, we have no way to retreat. We not only should prevent the invasion of illegal immigrants, but we have to stop their new born children’s citizenship. only doing so in order to fundamentally solve the problem of illegal immigration.

It's actually not all that wrong. It could've specified that the ambassador and foreign service officer died at the diplomatic mission and the two CIA contractors died at the nearby CIA outpost. It's absolutely correct that both Obama and Clinton received criticism, though going into detail about who did or did not pay attention to warnings and requests regarding security may not be necessary. That said, this is an event where an ambassador was killed representing the country overseas, both a rare and noteworthy event indeed. -  ''''

That sort of thing belongs in articles about party politics, and in fact it is in those articles,  -

706207138.353.369,"First off, thanks to the editors who crafted a lot of great narrative content, especially the well-rounded lead.
As this page has grown and his presidency has encompassed everything a president does (speeches, policies, elections, and so on), it seems to have lost a good narrative flow. It's unfortunately not the Featured Article it was on the day of his election. Specifically, there's not a particularly cohesive narrative of his presidency. There's a long list of policy views and actions, but not a general history. This leads to a feeling that it's disconnected. I’ll note that [WIKI_LINK: Presidency of Barack Obama] doesn’t have a cohesive narrative either, instead compromising several lists and a bunch of separate policy areas. Work on this page can carry over to that one.
As a model article I will point to [WIKI_LINK: Bill Clinton] (and [WIKI_LINK: Hillary Clinton], although she’s not yet a president). The section on his presidency blends his [WIKI_LINK: United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992#Democratic primary|political story], his [WIKI_LINK: Lewinsky scandal|personal quirks], his [WIKI_LINK: North American Free Trade Agreement|policy achievements] (and [WIKI_LINK: Clinton health care plan of 1993|failures]), his [WIKI_LINK: Economic policy of Bill Clinton|overall effect on the country], and the broader context in which his presidency occurred, in a reasonably easy-to-follow way. The only section dedicated to particular policies (“Military and foreign events”) is a cohesive and roughly chronological account.
What would be great is a '''10+ paragraph walkthrough of the general course of Obama’s presidency''': the ups and downs, the major initiatives ([WIKI_LINK: Obamacare] and [WIKI_LINK: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|rebooting the economy] in particular). Imagine if you want to read for 5 minutes about what he's done. It's not feasible to peruse through a dozen different sections on his energy, Iraq, health care, LGBT, immigration, etc. positions. That would be difficult to follow. The intricate details of his policy achievements are better suited to in-depth articles like [WIKI_LINK: Barack Obama social policy]. Elevating the most notable accomplishments and trimming the others allows this article to stay reasonably-sized and engaging.
The way I think about it is as a biography: when you look back at the overall term, what are the most important bits and what is your general impression? Now condense that into an article for a general audience. The smaller initiatives aren't going to be defining aspects of his legacy. A good biography is going to include a well-balanced account from start to finish, mentioning landmark achievements, his [WIKI_LINK: Social policy of Barack Obama#LGBT issues|biggest thematic priorities] (and [WIKI_LINK: Gun control after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|unsuccessful efforts]), and all the other things swirling around, some of which are out of his control. Important aspects of his meta-presidency include the slow but steady economic growth, continued instability in the Middle East alongside the rise of ISIS, increasing public support for LGBT rights (helping him in 2012), a bigger and more heated focus on race relations, and the loss of Democratic majorities alongside increasingly stark political partisanship (see [WIKI_LINK: Tea Party]). Many of these things are consequences of deeper trends, but he played a role in shaping or responding to each. You can't remove a person from their historical context.
It's also worth addressing the contrast between the campaign ideal of ""Yes We Can"" (political unity and racial solidarity), and the actual history. While we elected an African-American president, we didn't solve our deep-seated racial conundrums. Again, this is not his fault, but it's an important theme to explore.
And it's got to be chronological. A biography doesn't jump from topic to topic in each new chapter.
This is the general idea. I'll work on something but these things are always a collaborative effort.
This is an article [EXTERNAL_LINK: '''tens of millions of people'''] have read or will read and I’m excited to make it better.

If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. These latina women have 5 or 6 children, each of them need help: educational expenses, medical expenses, housing, child care, child support, food and social workers for services, they even let you pay their babysitter wages. It is extremely ridiculous, the children are theirs, but you have to pay it. Their social expenses are at astronomical amount, the United States will go bankrupt as many Latin countries. The reason why illegal immigrant families have a lot of child birth, because the social welfare of these children is their source of livelihood. The United States now has up to 60 trillion debt, and still rising fast. if you don’t control the illegal immigration problem, it will bring more financial burden to the country. I believe the vast majority of African Americans do not really support the invasion of illegal immigrants, illegal immigrants families will compete for limited resources of social welfare with black families, this should be very clear in their mind. Departure from the long-term interests of the United States, we must eradicate the illegal immigration problem. The most fundamental solution is: Repeal the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause,BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. Otherwise the situation will soon be out of control, their population growth is faster than you think. Why does a legal immigrant child have to wait many years to become a citizen but an illegal immigrant child can become a citizen immediately? which is very unreasonable and unfair. If the United States can revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, The first it could solve the problem of illegal immigration, and the second it could reduce the federal government deficit, the third and also the most important thing is to prevent the United States to become another Mexico or central america country.
Good natural conditions in Mexico, the country has a long coastline and numerous sea port; it has excellent climatic conditions to facilitate the production of agriculture; it has a lot of natural resources such as oil and natural gas; the illegal immigrants in the United States send hundreds billions of dollars into Mexico every year; it gets the best terms of trade from the United States, a lot of goods from overseas shipped to Mexico, they only need to paste a trademark and transport to the United States alone this one they can get huge trade taxes ; they have a modern democratic system which can choose their president and parliamentarians. I would like to ask Excellency: what anything else do they need in the end? But Mexico is still just Mexico.
Once the Latino population is more than whites, they will have their congressmen, judges and the President, the border will become more severe, then it is completely out of control, and soon the United States will become Mexico. The development of things has a critical point, and now the United States is at a critical point in the eve, after this critical point, the development of things will nosedive.
For some business operators: don’t think that illegal immigration can provide cheap labor for you. They and their children will eventually be in a variety of social tax burden-sharing approach to each person's head, and now the high government debt of 60 trillion has fully proved this point.
The United States now has very serious financial situation, and if you do not control the invasion of illegal immigrants, the U.S. Latinism of laissez-faire, the consequences will be more serious. Like many South American countries, the end result is bankruptcy. I'll give you an example, there is a South American country called Argentina, the government of that country has gone bankrupt, and there are a lot of foreign banks sue the government to recover the debt in foreign courts, they are afraid to take their own aircraft for presidential visit of foreign country, because once the plane landed on foreign nation is likely to be debt secured and detained by the foreign courts. So they came up with an idea: rent British aircraft. Argentina had fought with the British, and was defeated, so their intention is to allow the foreign courts to detain the British aircraft, in retaliation for the British. As everyone knows leased aircraft is not equal to property rights, their intention just let the whole world see a joke.
I therefore call on all Americans to tell your representatives and senators, we do not want to turn the United States into Mexico, we never want so-called immigration reform, the act we want to take: Revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, tell the illegal immigrants  BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. To solve the problem of illegal immigration from the root, this will be the standards as you choose congressman and 2016 presidential election. Every American should be soberly aware that fatal hazards caused by illegal immigration to the United States are far exceeding all political differences.
The United States want to keep its leadership in the world, relying on the absolute leading position in cutting-edge technology in the field of defense, not by cheap labor. Recently the Russians have invaded the Ukraine, their nuclear weapons could destroy the world several times, could Mexicans deal with them?
Problem of illegal immigration to the United States is far more dangerous than 911, it will weaken the strength of country from inside, cause the collapse of the U.S. economy, and turn the United States into Mexico in the end. If there is any government policy signs of loosening for immigration, it will be followed by a large influx of illegal immigrants, all the recent events in the US-Mexican border have confirmed this point. United States and Mexico has nearly 2,000 miles of border, imagine the complexity of the problem. In addition to strengthening border patrol (If you ask Latinos to help you perform border patrol, that is a waste of taxpayers' money. In television I saw a group of reporters at the shooting scene of illegal immigrants across the border, even the reporters carrying photographic equipment arrived earlier than the Border Patrol), we should simplify of repatriation procedures, establish a rapid 24 hours repatriation channel, but we more need establish a comprehensive integrated management and control system, the most important thing is to revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause. We use the law to tell the invasion aliens, BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP, they want to change the United States with a large number of fertility, seize the power of U.S. government, then turn the United States into Mexico, but they will never achieve their dreams!

In response to concerns, I typed the words ""Benghazi criticism"" into Google Search. I reached ] article from ABC News as the 5th option. In addition to having the word ""Criticisms"" in the title, it also includes that word or some derivative of it 7 times in the body of the article. What more do you need?
:Nope. This does not stand for the proposition that Obama received substantial criticism, or Clinton either. It reports that in a ""leaked chapter"" of Clinton's now-released book, ''Hard Choices'', she refutes Republican critics vis-a-vis Benghazi. 'Criticism' and 'critic' are different words. Criticism, in the sense used, is an expression of disapproval of somebody or something based on a good faith perception of faults, motives, or mistakes. A critic of someone is not making judgments about whether to approve or disapprove, they are a detractor. This piece, and the great majority of others covering her book chapter, describe this as a reaction to Republican critics, not to widespread disapproval. -

::Seriously - what's it going to take? Here's a short list mentioning response to Obama being criticized over Benghazi.
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: LA Times - U.S. officials counter criticism in Benghazi attack]
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: NPR - After Benghazi Hearings, Flurry Of Concern Unsettled]
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: CNN - White House under assault over Obamacare, NSA, Benghazi]
::This is, of course leaving out the apparently unacceptable fox news articles, and any outlet that might have even a small non-left tilt. He has pretty clearly received substantial criticism regarding Benghazi.
:::No, no, and no. Quite likely nothing is going to help because what you are trying to source — that Obama was the subject of criticism over Benghazi, as opposed to partisan political detractors, does not appear to be what the neutral mainstream sources report. If we get past that, or found language describing it like the sources do as a partisan controversy rather than a criticism, we have a weight issue. Is it really biographically significant about the President that this one controversy, among twenty or thirty that his Republican detractors tried to hang on him, became a big deal for them in 2014-2015? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. We don't report all the controversies from earlier news cycles (Ayers, the birthers, etc.) but we do report at least one in passing, resigning from Jeremiah Wright's church, but that one, involving his religious affiliation, does seem more biographical and directly related to him. -
::::The simple fact is that there is already a section for Libya. It's entirely appropriate to include the Benghazi attack and the fact that an ambassador was killed. Can we agree on at least that much?
::::As for any criticism or fallout faced by Obama and his cabinet, I'm sure if we add some additional sources, we can agree what should (or shouldn't) be added and how it should be worded. -  ''''
:::The ""small non-left tilt"" jab is cute, but irrelevant. Those sources still state the attacks are from Republicans and there is no mainstream criticism of Obama for a terrorist attack on an Embassy based in Libya. As for edit warring the paragraph into the article and then claiming you need consensus to remove it, that's absurd, and shows that editors have no real understanding of Wiki policy.
::::So, just because it's from Republicans means the criticism is both invalid, and non-mainstream - if I'm interpreting your comment correctly? I've been around for about 10 years, I'm not a new editor.

705728062.2.2,"BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. Then what kind of show their politicians will have, I can also tell you now. First, they would further proclaim that they are the masters of this land, whites are immigrants from Europe, for the last few decades whites hinder the immigration issue on the latino, they will ask whites apology, and require constant apology even want an apology written into the Constitution, in order to approve latinos with the naturally born owned rights of the land. WASP created the modern civilization on this primitive land, and instantly turned into second-class citizens and foreign sojourners. Latinos will require a fully representing of the government, for revenge, they will further squeeze out the white forces from various government departments, the easiest way is to open the borders and let 100 million illegal immigrants enter the United States, in short time to obtain a residence permit and the right to vote. Any objections raised by whites, will be deducted racism hat.
After completion of the political siege followed is the economy. They will clearly require Latinos in economic activity must occupy most of proportion, they will use government power to intervene directly, whites will be forced to withdraw and abandon all economic activities. Latino government officials at all levels will use the power in their hands, full penetration into various socio-economic levels. The combination of power and money, then that is a comprehensive social corruption. To get any of the white business survival and development in this society, not by technological innovation, production efficiency and improve service levels, but to rely on bribery of government officials at all levels, and the appropriate government officials get a lot of opportunities for corruption in this way. This is a typical Latin America bureaucratic economy. Under this social environment, WASP wisdom and creativity will disappear, which is what these politicians want: completely destroy any whites’ confidence and the demands of society, in order to consolidate the power base of Latino politicians. As for the collapse of social economy and severe recession, which is not within the scope of their care, they care about is how there are more opportunities for them wantonly corruption. They have nothing to fear, because they know that even if they rape of women in the office doorway, their voters would still support them, because those voters would seriously believe that woman deliberately seduced their politician.
These Latino politicians but also would establish an image in the world as America is Latino America, Latinos are the real masters of the United States. Whites will be in very bad situation. If you want to emigrate, Europe has been very crowded, and there are 25 million Arab Muslims, the Muslims will always remember under white rule in the United States who helped Jews. Canada could be a destination, but it will be very difficult for the Canadian government, because under pressure they must audit white immigrants and latino immigrants equally, otherwise it will be treated as racial discrimination. Measures ultimately adopted across the board, that's all refused. American whites won’t be able to go any place, waiting for the U.S. to become a central America country or Mexico. So my suggestion to all whites, now you go for a trip to Mexico or Guatemala, but do not bring any cash in pocket, because it is not to let you go on vacation, you try to survive there for six months, and then you tell me your experience and new decision on the U.S. immigration policy.
With the decline of the United States, the pattern of the world also will be changed. American leadership will become a big international joke. When the world appears multi-power forces, and they do not mutually recognize each other, it’s the time to begin ringing alarm of new world war.  Britain, France and Germany will again seek dominance in Europe, Germany and Japan would break the restrictions on nuclear weapons, technology and capacity in both countries, they can produce the world's most sophisticated strategic offensive nuclear weapons. Russia will be ready to be tested, to regain regional hegemony. Republics of the former Soviet Union will be very frightened, fearing Russia's annexation, but eventually could not escape to become a vassal state. Arab Muslim extremists will quickly rise and rule the whole Arab world under extremism religious regime, and soon they will acquire nuclear technology and nuclear weapons, Israel will be their proving ground. Israel can only withstand one atomic bomb attack on their small territory, before the country is completely destroyed, they will project out all 160 nuclear weapons. Thus began the end of the world.
When someone asks me if so logical reasoning can explain the progressing of the world situation, my answer is yes. Understand the modern history of Europe, people know that there was no World War I, there would be no World War II, there would be also no international communism of former Soviet Union as well, and all these, were from a car driver getting lost his way. The progressing of human history, sometimes have people sigh.
I therefore call on all Americans, tell your representatives and senators, we must take this action: Revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. we should stop the illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship! Which member of Congress will support this action, she or he is your congresswoman or congressman. Which members of Congress will oppose this action, you should consider an alternative candidate. On the 2016 election, which presidential candidate will propose the so-called immigration reform, you should say no to him or her; Which presidential candidate will sign the Act of cancellation of illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship, you should support his or her election . These days all the occurrence on US-Mexico border has proven these illegal immigrants and their agents in the U.S. political arena echoed in vain, they disregard the interests of united states, constantly squeezing the tolerance of this country, they just want to turn the U.S. into Mexico. This proves once again as I judged before: a person's genes and DNA determine his brain and way of thinking. Latino create mexico, WASP create the United States. some people may feel harsh, but it is a fact. In order to keep U.S. leadership and splendid civilization in the world, in order to prevent the United States to become another Mexico, we have no way to retreat. We not only should prevent the invasion of illegal immigrants, but we have to stop their new born children’s citizenship. only doing so in order to fundamentally solve the problem of illegal immigration. The time is ticking.  — Preceding [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned] comment added by   •

705727876.2.2,"BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. Then what kind of show their politicians will have, I can also tell you now. First, they would further proclaim that they are the masters of this land, whites are immigrants from Europe, for the last few decades whites hinder the immigration issue on the latino, they will ask whites apology, and require constant apology even want an apology written into the Constitution, in order to approve latinos with the naturally born owned rights of the land. WASP created the modern civilization on this primitive land, and instantly turned into second-class citizens and foreign sojourners. Latinos will require a fully representing of the government, for revenge, they will further squeeze out the white forces from various government departments, the easiest way is to open the borders and let 100 million illegal immigrants enter the United States, in short time to obtain a residence permit and the right to vote. Any objections raised by whites, will be deducted racism hat.
After completion of the political siege followed is the economy. They will clearly require Latinos in economic activity must occupy most of proportion, they will use government power to intervene directly, whites will be forced to withdraw and abandon all economic activities. Latino government officials at all levels will use the power in their hands, full penetration into various socio-economic levels. The combination of power and money, then that is a comprehensive social corruption. To get any of the white business survival and development in this society, not by technological innovation, production efficiency and improve service levels, but to rely on bribery of government officials at all levels, and the appropriate government officials get a lot of opportunities for corruption in this way. This is a typical Latin America bureaucratic economy. Under this social environment, WASP wisdom and creativity will disappear, which is what these politicians want: completely destroy any whites’ confidence and the demands of society, in order to consolidate the power base of Latino politicians. As for the collapse of social economy and severe recession, which is not within the scope of their care, they care about is how there are more opportunities for them wantonly corruption. They have nothing to fear, because they know that even if they rape of women in the office doorway, their voters would still support them, because those voters would seriously believe that woman deliberately seduced their politician.
These Latino politicians but also would establish an image in the world as America is Latino America, Latinos are the real masters of the United States. Whites will be in very bad situation. If you want to emigrate, Europe has been very crowded, and there are 25 million Arab Muslims, the Muslims will always remember under white rule in the United States who helped Jews. Canada could be a destination, but it will be very difficult for the Canadian government, because under pressure they must audit white immigrants and latino immigrants equally, otherwise it will be treated as racial discrimination. Measures ultimately adopted across the board, that's all refused. American whites won’t be able to go any place, waiting for the U.S. to become a central America country or Mexico. So my suggestion to all whites, now you go for a trip to Mexico or Guatemala, but do not bring any cash in pocket, because it is not to let you go on vacation, you try to survive there for six months, and then you tell me your experience and new decision on the U.S. immigration policy.
With the decline of the United States, the pattern of the world also will be changed. American leadership will become a big international joke. When the world appears multi-power forces, and they do not mutually recognize each other, it’s the time to begin ringing alarm of new world war.  Britain, France and Germany will again seek dominance in Europe, Germany and Japan would break the restrictions on nuclear weapons, technology and capacity in both countries, they can produce the world's most sophisticated strategic offensive nuclear weapons. Russia will be ready to be tested, to regain regional hegemony. Republics of the former Soviet Union will be very frightened, fearing Russia's annexation, but eventually could not escape to become a vassal state. Arab Muslim extremists will quickly rise and rule the whole Arab world under extremism religious regime, and soon they will acquire nuclear technology and nuclear weapons, Israel will be their proving ground. Israel can only withstand one atomic bomb attack on their small territory, before the country is completely destroyed, they will project out all 160 nuclear weapons. Thus began the end of the world.
When someone asks me if so logical reasoning can explain the progressing of the world situation, my answer is yes. Understand the modern history of Europe, people know that there was no World War I, there would be no World War II, there would be also no international communism of former Soviet Union as well, and all these, were from a car driver getting lost his way. The progressing of human history, sometimes have people sigh.
I therefore call on all Americans, tell your representatives and senators, we must take this action: Revoke the 14th amendment of the US constitution about outdated citizenship clause, BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP. we should stop the illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship! Which member of Congress will support this action, she or he is your congresswoman or congressman. Which members of Congress will oppose this action, you should consider an alternative candidate. On the 2016 election, which presidential candidate will propose the so-called immigration reform, you should say no to him or her; Which presidential candidate will sign the Act of cancellation of illegal immigrants new born children’s citizenship, you should support his or her election . These days all the occurrence on US-Mexico border has proven these illegal immigrants and their agents in the U.S. political arena echoed in vain, they disregard the interests of united states, constantly squeezing the tolerance of this country, they just want to turn the U.S. into Mexico. This proves once again as I judged before: a person's genes and DNA determine his brain and way of thinking. Latino create mexico, WASP create the United States. some people may feel harsh, but it is a fact. In order to keep U.S. leadership and splendid civilization in the world, in order to prevent the United States to become another Mexico, we have no way to retreat. We not only should prevent the invasion of illegal immigrants, but we have to stop their new born children’s citizenship. only doing so in order to fundamentally solve the problem of illegal immigration. The time is ticking.

:Nope. This does not stand for the proposition that Obama received substantial criticism, or Clinton either. It reports that in a ""leaked chapter"" of Clinton's now-released book, ''Hard Choices'', she refutes Republican critics vis-a-vis Benghazi. 'Criticism' and 'critic' are different words. Criticism, in the sense used, is an expression of disapproval of somebody or something based on a good faith perception of faults, motives, or mistakes. A critic of someone is not making judgments about whether to approve or disapprove, they are a detractor. This piece, and the great majority of others covering her book chapter, describe this as a reaction to Republican critics, not to widespread disapproval. -

I am sure that this has been brought up before, but I still do not understand it? Isn't it as correct to say that he is a white president as it is to say he is an African American. I think this needs to be worded better. Here are a few things I propose:
>the first person of mixed race to hold the office
>the first  half  African American to hold the office
>the first person of both African American and White descent to hold the office
> first person of African American descent (if you cannot change it to the other ones, this is what it should be changed to)
These are all correct. The current statement, to my knowledge, is incorrect, but maybe I am wrong? Correct me if this is the case.

That means it is essentially a summary of a lot of child articles (and for Obama, there are a '''lot'''). With that in mind, it is usually better to get the child articles right ''first'' and then summarize their content here. Of course that can make it difficult to weave it into a cohesive narrative, and that brings me to my second point. ""Narratives"" that tell a story, rather than simply describe events separately, have a tendency to approach or cross a line into [WIKI_LINK: WP:SYN|synthesis].

In response to concerns, I typed the words ""Benghazi criticism"" into Google Search. I reached ] article from ABC News as the 5th option. In addition to having the word ""Criticisms"" in the title, it also includes that word or some derivative of it 7 times in the body of the article. What more do you need?
:Nope. This does not stand for the proposition that Obama received substantial criticism, or Clinton either. It reports that in a ""leaked chapter"" of Clinton's now-released book, ''Hard Choices'', she refutes Republican critics vis-a-vis Benghazi. 'Criticism' and 'critic' are different words. Criticism, in the sense used, is an expression of disapproval of somebody or something based on a good faith perception of faults, motives, or mistakes. A critic of someone is not making judgments about whether to approve or disapprove, they are a detractor. This piece, and the great majority of others covering her book chapter, describe this as a reaction to Republican critics, not to widespread disapproval. -
Checking back here to see if any consensus has developed yet, but I can't see any. I've added a low profile maintenance template, to indicate there is some dispute over the inclusion. In the end, if there is no consensus for inclusion it should probably be removed I guess. — Martin ( ·
::Seriously - what's it going to take? Here's a short list mentioning response to Obama being criticized over Benghazi.

::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: NPR - After Benghazi Hearings, Flurry Of Concern Unsettled]
::* [EXTERNAL_LINK: CNN - White House under assault over Obamacare, NSA, Benghazi]
::This is, of course leaving out the apparently unacceptable fox news articles, and any outlet that might have even a small non-left tilt. He has pretty clearly received substantial criticism regarding Benghazi.
:::No, no, and no. Quite likely nothing is going to help because what you are trying to source — that Obama was the subject of criticism over Benghazi, as opposed to partisan political detractors, does not appear to be what the neutral mainstream sources report. If we get past that, or found language describing it like the sources do as a partisan controversy rather than a criticism, we have a weight issue. Is it really biographically significant about the President that this one controversy, among twenty or thirty that his Republican detractors tried to hang on him, became a big deal for them in 2014-2015? Perhaps yes, perhaps no. We don't report all the controversies from earlier news cycles (Ayers, the birthers, etc.) but we do report at least one in passing, resigning from Jeremiah Wright's church, but that one, involving his religious affiliation, does seem more biographical and directly related to him. -

== Obama Nobel prize ==
From the article:
Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize was a ""failure""
This suggests that the director of the Nobel Institute feels that Obama is undeserving of the award, while the referenced article actually states that the director expected the honor to deliver a boost to Obama, something he believes did not happen. In other words its a failure of the award to boost Obama, not a failure of Obama as the Wikipedia article seems to suggest. — Preceding [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Signatures|",COMMENT_REMOVAL,,698238189.0.0,75.109.165.13,699572091,Talk:Barack Obama,2016-01-13 03:37:10.000000 UTC

It's absolutely correct that both Obama and Clinton received criticism, though going into detail about who did or did not pay attention to warnings and requests regarding security may not be necessary.

I do not believe that anyone supporting the inclusion of the paragraph has attempted to argue either way on the talk page.

Clinton has been investigated for her conduct and many have claimed that she did not do enough to ensure the safety of the Americans in the country. The Fox News article clearly states that.

701526624.254.692,":I think the reasoning is that in the U.S. the honorific ""The Honorable"" is unofficial.  In the British Commonwealth OTOH it is regulated by statute and can only be used when one holds an office.  (Former cabinet ministers remain ""The Honourable"" for life due to their continuing membership in privy councils.)

699574941.557.0,":Comment: That the president has this title is mentioned/wikilinked in the [WIKI_LINK: President of the United States] article (in the infobox). I think the use of ""The Honorable"" here (that is, above the name in the infobox) should be the same for all US presidents, so I checked how we currently do this for Obamas 17 most recent predessessors (W. to Taft). 12 of those are without the title, like this article is now. 4 has the title, and Ike has ""General of the Army"". I suggest we make these articles consistently without a title, slightly supported by the spirit of [WIKI_LINK: WP:Honorifics] and current practice in most US president articles.

708146177.9448.9448,":::::, you can add a second source if you want. As for your concerns about neutrality, all of the investigations and inquiries count under the word ""criticism."" Basically, this paragraph is a very brief summary of a very complicated thing, with more to be found on the Benghazi attacks article and on the Hillary Clinton biography. It may be possible for you to add an extra sentence or two concerning the subsequent investigations if you so desire, as long as you leave non-neutral wording such as ""shocking politicization"" out of the article. However, wouldn't that that contradicting your previous statements regarding [WIKI_LINK: WP:Undue weight], as things would seemingly begin to drift further from Obama and into the Clinton realm? This is because, while ""criticism"" applies to both Obama and Clinton, investigations apply only to Clinton.

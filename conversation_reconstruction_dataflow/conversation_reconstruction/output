==Portrayal of Chechen Resistance Leaders==

The unsourced claim at the end of the Career section that Politkovskaya wrote "flattering" articles about Chechen Rebel/Terrorist leaders, including those responsible for Beslan, seems dubious. Maybe a deliberate attempt to discredit? Although I can't claim to have read these interviews, which I assume are likely to only be available in Russian language, I have read an article on the Observer (Sunday version of the Guardian) website which would directly contradict this. Tom Parfitt writes "Critics accused her of being partisan in her damning reports on the cruelty of Russian federal forces, but Politkovskaya did not hold back on criticism of the Chechen rebels' brutal tactics either." [EXTERNA_LINK: http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1890481,00.html]

So I propose to change the article to suit and cite the above as a source.

Anyways should we change the title from Death to Assassination or not? Even though it is very likely a hit, Wikipedia does not like to engage in speculation. Therefore if we changed the title to Assassination, then we leave out the possiblity of somekind of bizarre suicide or just random street crime/violence, which would be POV.

which was also promoted by FSB-related media such as \"utro\" and others. So, he decided that Terkibaev (who died soon in car crash) was a fake . Dullop was also wrong in some other details. Real spy story! So, the real Abu Bakar was probably Terkibaev, but that is difficult to write down.

And, the second point is that we really carry out our own investigation, we really very closely cooperate with the investigators. In August 30, 2007, journalists of [WIKI_LINK: Novaya Gazeta] and son of Anna Ilya Politkovskiy have issued a statement about the ongoing investigation. In it they have claimed that not all involved people were arrested; as well as the Prosecutor's Office has yet to do lots of routine work to prove the guilt of those arrested, however Novaya Gazeta's own investigation shows that \"arrested people were really involved in this crime in this or that degree\".\n:First, it\u2019s not all involved who are arrested.:Second, the guilt of those arrested is to be proved. Our own investigation done allows us to assume that the arrested people were really involved in this crime in this or that degree, but the prosecutors will have to do a lot of routine work: interrogations, confrontations and additional searches. It\u2019s not today or this year that the trial will be held.\nThe major issue addressed by journalists of Novaya Gazeta was the leak organized in the media, which has seriously complicated the work of investigators and could let other involved people escape. According to the journalists, \"It seems that someone had a wish to make the currents list of suspected to be final and, besides, not to let solving other crimes that could possibly have been done by the arrested.\"\n:Fourth, and the main, the leak organized in the media because someone had a wish to gain something and someone wanted to prevent investigation to establish all the circumstances of the contract murder of the journalist, this leak has complicated the whole situation. ... Now those people can guess the main direction of the investigation and have opportunities to escape.Details of the investigation were kept in secret for almost ten months, that being controlled by the chief of official investigative group and journalists of [WIKI_LINK: Novaya Gazeta] on their side.

And, the second point is that we really carry out our own investigation, we really very closely cooperate with the investigators. In August 30, 2007, journalists of [WIKI_LINK: Novaya Gazeta] and son of Anna Ilya Politkovskiy have issued a statement about the ongoing investigation. In it they have claimed that not all involved people were arrested; as well as the Prosecutor's Office has yet to do lots of routine work to prove the guilt of those arrested, however Novaya Gazeta's own investigation shows that \"arrested people were really involved in this crime in this or that degree\".\n:First, it\u2019s not all involved who are arrested.:Second, the guilt of those arrested is to be proved. Our own investigation done allows us to assume that the arrested people were really involved in this crime in this or that degree, but the prosecutors will have to do a lot of routine work: interrogations, confrontations and additional searches. It\u2019s not today or this year that the trial will be held.\nThe major issue addressed by journalists of Novaya Gazeta was the leak organized in the media, which has seriously complicated the work of investigators and could let other involved people escape. According to the journalists, \"It seems that someone had a wish to make the currents list of suspected to be final and, besides, not to let solving other crimes that could possibly have been done by the arrested.\"\n:Fourth, and the main, the leak organized in the media because someone had a wish to gain something and someone wanted to prevent investigation to establish all the circumstances of the contract murder of the journalist, this leak has complicated the whole situation. ... Now those people can guess the main direction of the investigation and have opportunities to escape.Details of the investigation were kept in secret for almost ten months, that being controlled by the chief of official investigative group and journalists of [WIKI_LINK: Novaya Gazeta] on their side. In August 27, Prosecutor General and special service officers held press-conferences. Although that wasn't a major breech in the secrecy of the case (besides one of the arrested, [WIKI_LINK: lieutenant colonel] of [WIKI_LINK: FSB] Pavel Ryaguzov, being named), it triggered a snowball of journalist publications and official appearances.

{"user_id": "784547", "user_text": "Disavian", "timestamp": "2007-10-10T02:53:30Z", "content": "\nTaken from\nThis letter has been received by the IPV News GULAG Project Editorial Office via E-mail on March 23, 2007. Taking into account the importance of the information, we found it necessary to provide its English translation with the maximum details retained.\nWe, the members of the Baysarov\u2019s group, address this to all the Chechens.\nMovladi was a bandit covered by the Military Intelligence of the 58th Army Corps. Since 1995 his activities in town of Dolinskoy included kidnapping people for ransom and stealing petrochemicals. Before the Second Chechen War he grew rich by allying himself with the military of the 58th Army engaged in illegal oil trade in the Russian territory. During the War, he was getting his dirty money from kidnapping and corpse trading, reinvesting the incom back into war. After Khasavyurt Treaty , Chechnya missed its chance to keep the granted freedom only due to the Regional Operations Staff (ROS) in the North Caucasus and its network. In fact, Baysarov came in contact with the Military Intelligence of the 58th Army as early as during the First Chechen War.\nFrom 1996 through 1997 Baysarov conducted illegal oil trade under the covering of the Counter-espionage Center of the 58th Army, in exchange for running their errands. He formed his first gang and provided them with ammunition from the Mozdok military base. M. Baysarov took control over illegal oil trade and kept it that way until the end of the last year. A portion of crude oil went to Stavropol, Krasnodar, and Rostov-on-Don regions.\nThe other portion [of crude oil mined] was refined right in the place, in Pobedinskoye, by means of the miniature refineries, to produce gasoline for \u201cinternal market\u201d. The numbers amount to hundreds of tons of oil produce, and the reason why Baysarov did not become a billionaire is that the illegal, criminal business requires very high expenses, such as bribery of the military \u201ccover\u201d providing through transportation of the oil cisterns out of Chechnya. The Chechen War is commonly called \u201ccommercial\u201d, meaning that corrupt local officials, military, politicians, and other involved do have an income out of it. The gist of the Second Chechen Campaign is to make the Chechens fight among themselves. Thus, Gantamirov [a pro-Moscow Chechen warlord who was at one time imprisoned on embezzlement charges \u2013 transl. remark], this convicted thief, was sent straight into battle from Butyrskaya Prison. Yamadaev, a bandit, was made a Russian lieutenant-colonel. Baysarov, however, received a lower military rank of major, but he was also offered a special position in Counter-Espionage Department of the 58th Army.\nMovladi came to GRU with his own people. In 2002, this gang was officially renamed into \u201ca group\u201d, but the true value of this formation was in actually remaining a gang. A military intelligence definition for it is \u201ca combat group which has a cover identity (legend) of a gang\u201d. I.e. on one hand, you work for GRU, and on the other you have to be known as a legendary bandit. The criminal oil business allowed maintaining the legend and financing of Baysarov\u2019s men. Movladi was stealing oil to have a wealthy lifestyle and sustain an armed gang\u2026 The Russians knew that, and provided covering for Baysarov\u2019s [illegal] business. Commercial interests firmly entangled with those of the military, and it wasn\u2019t possible to resolve this intricate matter in a combat field. As the matter of fact, Movladi hardly distinguished himself between a bandit and an intelligence officer. His infamous reputation of a bold commander of the \u201cHundred of Chechens\u201d along with the connections in FSB-GRU, began to bring him noticeable profits, even in Moscow. Being acquainted with Baisarov, one was guaranteed a successful business; besides, Movladi himself didn\u2019t necessarily have to settle any business related disputes by force.\nSince the early days of the Second [Chechen] war, Movlady\u2019s brother, named Sharani, was put on an intelligence mission as the Chief Body Guard of Akhmad-Khadzhi Kadyrov, so the Military Intelligence gained an information source on the activity of the [pro-Kremlin] head of Chechnya. He was permanently under observation of the Military Intelligence the 58th Army. After the assassination of Akhmad Kadyrov (May 9, 2005), Sharani was deposed because [Ramzan] Kadyrov [the son of Akhmad Kadyrov \u2013 transl. remark] became suspicious, stirred up by his buddies from the FSB of Russia. When Sharani Baysarov died in car explosion, the rumors spread that Ramzan Kadyrov took vengeance for the killing of his father. Soon enough, tension broke between Ramzan Kadyrov and Movladi Baysarov. One time, Kadyrov invited three subordinates of Baysarov and offered them to travel to Moscow for a certain mission. In Moscow, all three of them had a visit with FSB colonel Igor Dranetz. During a week they lived in some apartment; Igor Dranetz provided them with food but kept them locked up. He also showed them the scheme of the house and the entrance where Anna Politkovskaya was supposed to appear from.\nOn the day of Politkovskaya murder, early in the morning, they were brought to the place in three cars. Dranetz said through a radio-set: \"this one!\" One of the three men shot Politkovskaya dead. All three returned home and went to Ramzan Kadyrov to make a report. After talking to them, Ramzan Kadyrov ordered his personal guards to take them back. On the way, near Khosi-Yurt, the guards drove into the forest and shot all three of the assassins. Movladi Baysarov had no idea where his men had been sent; he found out the truth only after they returned from Moscow. After they never came back from Kadyrov\u2019s, the relatives of these three missing guys came to Baysarov complaining. On the second day the burned bodies of the three men were found and identified. Movladi Baysarov went to see Ramsan Kadyrov and they had a fight. Kadyrov denied sending anybody from Baysarov\u2019s \u201cgroup\u201d anywhere. He denied even contacting with them. Then Baysarov rebuked Kadyrov reminding him about his brother Zelimhan whom he helped to get out of prison when Zelimhan was arrested on drug charge in Pyatigorsk.\n\u201cFor your father\u2019s sake I took the local FSB head of Naursky region and his deputy hostage and lost several men in a conflict with Kakiyev!\u201d claimed Baysarov. When Kadyrov heard of his brother (who was a drug addict), he punched Baysarov into face. In response, Movladi swore that Kadyrov would never get away with killing his brother Sharani.\nAfter this scandal Movladi Baysarov switched sides. Now he sided with Alu Alkhanov, even though his \u201cblood-enemy\u201d, S.-M. Kakiyev, worked for him. Taking advantage of his authority in Chechnya, Ramsan Kadyrov disbanded Baysarov\u2019s gang and put him on the \u201cwanted criminals\u201d list. Baysarov\u2019s \u201cHundred men\u201d eventually surrendered to Kadyrov\u2019s authority, yet, only after being ordered so by their commander, who was living in Moscow at that time\nMovladi was devilishly shrewd in manipulating his people. By the end of his life, he still had a gang, consisted of those whom he relied on. Some of them had remained with him since the 1998 \u201ccall for arms\u201d. The others were \u201cthe newly drafted\u201d, mainly opponents of Kadyrov\u2019s regime in Chechnya. While in Moscow, Baysarov made numerous visits to high offices of FSB, GRU, MVD of Russia, but all in vain. Everybody reminded him taking an FSB colonel, named Ushakov, and his deputy hostage. GRU refused to protect its former agent, throwing him out like a used rag. Being aware of that, Kadyrov dispatched his most loyal men to Moscow to eliminate Baysarov. Not only did he seek to kill his enemy, but also to confiscate his personal property. The only Baysarov\u2019s property remained is an apartment in Taganski District of Moscow officially owned by his older brother. Movladi, being an officer and a gangster at the same time, did not have any legal possessions: he would have difficulty legitimizing his assets. Also the names of his trusted men were well known to his enemies.\nOne of Baysarov\u2019s financial aides was fired by him for being professionally unfit (actually, for the lack of toughness). Baysarov\u2019s enemies immediately took advantage of the fired aide. They found out from him where Barayev\u2019s estates were, and took everything. The Chechen customs forbid confiscation from the dead. Those who killed their enemies would secretly sustain the orphans they made. However, this custom of the Highlander\u2019s nobility was not observed by Kadyrov\u2019s gang. Baysarov knew far too much; he was as dangerous to Kadyrov as he was to FSB and GRU. It is why he was killed. After murdering Baysarov, Kadyrov had rid of the puppet Alkhanov. At present time the remainder of Baysarov\u2019s gang is eliminated. We, the members of Baysarov\u2019s gang forced to leave Chechnya because of Kadyrov\u2019s hostility, are addressing to all deceived and taken advantage of: draw conclusions from the story.\nTimur from Kirov\nAslambeck from Lenin Sovkhoz\nImran Kurkayev (nick-named \u201cIpan\u201d) from Samashki\nAdam (nick-named \u201cDentist\u201d) from Samashki\nRoman Karnukayev from Somashki", "parent_id": "120064123.39983.39958", "replyTo_id": null, "indentation": 0, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_REMOVAL", "id": "163483926.0.25", "rev_id": "163483926"}

{"user_id": "784547", "user_text": "Disavian", "timestamp": "2007-10-10T02:56:28Z", "content": "\n:What are you talking about? Politkovskaya was not \"anti-Russian\", she was very much \"pro-Russian\"! There is nothing \"anti-Russian\" in this article.\n::I am talking about very one-sided coverage of the issue. In criticising elected by the people government with elected by the people president she is not pro-russian - since it were Russians, who were and are in support of government. Not all of them, but over half. In this article point of view, which considers Politkovskaya to be merely anti-government puppet, who was associated with and in support of terrorism is not present, while it is factually there as well. I am not going to argue, which perspective is the right one, but both perspectives need to be voiced.\n:::\"In criticising elected by the people government with elected by the people president she is not pro-russian - since it were Russians, who were and are in support of government.\" This is a fundamentally incorrect argument: in a (nominally) democratic system, criticizing the government is not the same thing as criticizing the nation, irrespective of how many people may or may not have voted for the current president/government. Additionally, arguing that \"both points of view\" must be in the article misunderstands both Wikipedia and the nature of topics such as this one. Firstly, there are more than two sides to any story. Secondly, the mere existence of a particular opinion does not mean that it must be incorporated into the article. If a point of view is a) notable, b) widely held, and above all c) documented in a reliable source, then it absolutely deserves to be there. However, if it does not meet all three of these criteria then including it reduces the quality of the article. At best, such information merely makes it messy and sub-standard, at worst it makes it severely biased.\n:::There are certainly POV and quality problems with this article when it comes to the choice of sources and the way in which that information is presented. The way to approach that is to assess the available information, assess the quality of the sources, use only those that are reputable and present the whole in as neutral a way as possible. Starting from the position of, \"[argument A] is not in this article, therefore it's biased\", inherently misunderstands the way Wikipedia is meant to work.\n:::: Let me put it simpler for you - in Chechnya Russian population has been slaughtered, all of it, before the military got involved. This is quite anti-Russian. Politkovskaya supported what the majority of Russians call \"terrorism\". This is also anti-Russian. Your point regarding quality of sources would render Politkovskaya's articles obsolete. If you don't like articles by other journalists, who don't praise Politkovskaya and find then \"bad sources\" - it is your problem, you should work on, but not a way wikipedia should treat material. Politkovskaya is not a national hero FYI in the country she was a journalist at explaining why deserves to be in the article.\n::Thank you very much Lost Angel. At last someone helped me to deal with these extreme POV reverters. I could tell you only one thing: regardless of political views, both Government and opposition use pretty much the same methods. Both Government and opposition suppress freedom of speech. And Politkovskaya wasn't a journalist, she was an opposition press warrior. And supporters of Politkovskaya here, support not the democracy, but support repressions and censorship. Please also see the best friend of Politkovskaya article [WIKI_LINK: Yevgeniya Alabts] and read what happened with one journalist when he criticized Politkovskaya. Alabats is the a classmate of Politkovskaya. Supporters of Politkovskaya are trying to delete what really happened. They also delete from the article information on support by Alabats of fascists \"Russian march\" in Moscow. Albats supported it, although a year ago she was blaming the authorities that they were not that good at preventing that march.\n:::Vlad Fedorov, no need for thanks, I'm not even sure getting involved is a reasonable thing to do - I have doubts that sound reason will prevail, rendering the effort meaningless in many ways. The way this article is now is simply rubbish writing of fanboys, unfortunately, which makes information value of the article extremely low. I'm appalled at how some wiki articles are informative, while others are under occupation by a bunch of fanatics.\n:::To others: no neutral perspective is possible, therefore effort should be made in the following directions: 1 internal logic of texts, 2 no self-sourcing of the person in question, 3 quoting actual passages from the sources when claims are made, 4 attributing sources, 5 not deleting or changing parts basing on your personal disagreement - improve, not delete/change, 6 Allowing for diverse perspective on the issue.\n::::Lost Angel: Without wishing to cause offense, you are no less a part of the problem you describe as the people you label as biased. Asserting that it's not even possible to have a neutral perspective on this subject is both ridiculous and, frankly, presumptuous to the point of being insulting. It is clear from your previous post that you've decided I'm some kind of Politkovskaya supporter even though you have no evidence on which to base such a claim. It appears that the only reason you've made this assumption is because I'm disagreeing with you. This kind of knee-jerk labeling is logically fallacious, obviously, but more importantly it has no place on this site. Belief that objectivity is possible is a prerequisite for Wikipedia editing. If you can't put yourself in that position and you don't believe that anyone else can either then I don't really understand why you're here.\n::::The bottom line is that Wikipedia's NPOV policy must be respected. This article is a great example of why biased editors need to check their personal opinions at the door. We've had a mountain of POV edits from pro-Polikovskaya and anti-Politkovskaya editors alike.

I am clearly arguing that multiple points of view should be represented, but only those that are a) notable, and b) reliably sourced. Perhaps I am wrong, but you don't appear to recognize the difference between reputable and non-reputable sources, content instead to assert that as long as a source is referenced then that's enough. Well it's not. The appearance of information somewhere on the Internet doesn't automatically mean that it is suitable for Wikipedia.

This article must make this very clear. Now this is not clear. Hence this comment by Lost Angel.\n::If her life and work were more important (for someone besides her of course) - she would've been (more) known to the people of the country she worked in, which was not the case until the murder took place. Sadly the greatest contribution to the public sphere is the end of her.\n:::Said who? Where did you get such information?\n::::Putin for example - read the text about her influence on political life. But I'm sure he is a bad source for you. Say what - enlighten me on her achievements. So I'd be able to evaluate them if I heard of any besides vague \"fought for human rights\"...\n:ilgiz: Regarding point #4 above, in the English-speaking world (to which this version of Wikipedia caters) Politkovskaya is known for being a murdered journalist first and an activist/journalist focusing on Chechnya second. Since Wikipedia is concerned with notability, her murder needs to be mentioned in the lead section. That section as seen in the most recent edit ([EXTERNAL_LINK: 23:39, May 18]) fulfills that notability requirement so it should be left as-is.\n:Lost Angel: You said, \"there is no need to shorten any factual material - wikipedia doesn't say \"articles be short\"\". This is incorrect. Wikipedia does have a policy that articles should not become too long, for several reasons. Please see the [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Article size] policy document.\n:: \"Though article size is no longer a binding rule, there remain stylistic reasons why the main body of an article should not be unreasonably long, including readability issues. It is instead treated as a guideline, and considered on a case by case basis, depending on the nature of the article.\"\n:::Exactly. I said, articles should not become too long, for several reasons, which is the same thing the quote you posted from the policy page says. That the policy is a guideline and not a binding rule doesn't change the fact that the whole point of the policy is to discourage long articles. If you'll notice, there is a message at the top of the edit page of every long article saying that it should be made shorter.\n:::I really don't understand why you're disputing this. It could hardly be more clear.\n::::We've drifted from my initial point - which was that cutting material not in favour of Politkovskaya is not justifiable by the need to simply reduce its size. There are many more other things that can be cut, since they're duplicating. I do, however, agree that the length of the article should not exceed recommended one without good reasons, which we here have.\n:Biophys: You said, \"Of course, her life and work were much more important than her death. This article must make this very clear.\" No, this article should not make that clear. Like all Wikipedia articles, this one should make clear only what is notable. Politkovskaya is notable (in the English-speaking world, at least) because she was a journalist/activist who was murdered, in all likelihood as a result of her work. From a notability perspective, the minutiae of the work itself is of secondary importance to the article, except where it relates to her murder.\n::How can you justify your opinion?  Of course, her death is notable. Of course, a lot of publications in press came out only after her death. But she was also a recipient of numerous International awards before her death, she published many notable articles and books, and she was a well known journalist in her own country. All of that should be reflected.\n:::Don't make me repeat myself - she was yet another anti-government journalist, a scandalous one. Popular with anti-government intelligentsia which loves anything anti government, Chechen terrorists, since she wrote in their interest. Imagine for a second a siege on an American school by muslim terrorists - them trusting a specific reporter might make you think... What made her special is her murder and its massive coverage. How many of her articles or books have you read before she died? I frankly didn't even know her name. Phoney awards don't really cut it.\n::::I read almost all her books and a lot of articles before her death. What you are talking about is your personal opinion, which is difficult to justify.\n::::: I quoted Putin for you regarding her importance. Hux here also considers death to be her main \"event\". So there are 3 of us, including 1 president, who disagree with you,- I suggest you revise your position in this regard in the face of reality.\n::::1.Phoney awards? Amnesty International is the most globally significant organization of its type, while the PEN and Lettre Ulysses awards are extremely well-respected internationally (the latter being probably the most significant award anyone can win in the field of reportage). These are not \"phoney\" by any stretch.\n::::2.This comment by you, as well as the comment, \"Sadly the greatest contribution to the public sphere is the end of her\", indicates a clear, unambiguous level of bias that is entirely inappropriate for Wikipedia.\n:::::1.I believe these organizations to be strongly politically biased. I disagree with their agenda - their awarding Politkovskaya is a sure sign of this for me. A point of view I am entitled to hold - are you suggesting policing my mind too?\n:::::2.This comment by me indicates my point of view on the issue at stake - however, what matters for wikipedia is the level of bias of my edits, rather than my pesonal opinion. If you truly fail to see the difference, I suggest you revise your personal bias in my regard.\n::::::You're entitled to your personal opinion, of course. I didn't mean to imply that you should not be here because of those opinions, only that personal bias must not find its way into Wikipedia articles and that your clearly expressed bias is something that concerns me. After all, how can a person even attempt to make NPOV edits when they themselves have argued that it is impossible to hold an NPOV on this topic? This is just my opinion though. As you correctly point out, our edits should be judged on their own merits.\n:::::::I believe you misunderstand me here - I am claiming that even reputable sources on this case are strongly biased and provide controversial image: terrorist supporter VS human rights activist. It isn't up to us to decide, which of them is POV and which is NPOV, but we should present both of them with reliable sources, nothing besides that. For any personal matters I suggest accessing my talk page.\n::::::::If indeed there are reputable sources that portray her in one way and equally reputable sources that portray her in a significantly different way then that would be newsworthy in and of itself, and I agree that it would be worth noting those differing portrayals and quoting examples. However, I question whether or not there really are such drastically different portrayals among such sources, because what you're describing is unprecedented as far as I'm aware. To make an exaggerated analogy, it would be like Newsweek categorizing S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal as a communist and Der Spiegel describing her as a fascist at the same time.\n::::::::Anyway, my point remains unchanged: as long as we strive for objectivity and utilize only good-quality source material the article will be fine. Any editor that can't do that should not be making any edits, as I hope you'll agree.\n:::Biophys: Perhaps you misunderstand me. I'm not saying that only her murder should be mentioned, I'm just saying that in the English-speaking world her murder is the most notable thing about her. This can be easily proven by a cursory search of major, English language news sources (BBC, New York Times, etc.), where you will find little mention of her work outside of the context of her murder. Therefore, her murder should be highlighted as the thing she is most known for. Discussion of her work obviously must be included as well, as must the perception of her and her work in Russia, but it should be of secondary significance in this article. (See also my reply to you in the \"Quotes\" section below.)\n:::Without wishing to draw any qualitative comparison between the two people in terms of their importance, consider the [WIKI_LINK: Martin Luther King] article: that article rightly spends significant time talking about his work, whilst his murder is afforded comparatively little article space. That's as it should be since King's work had a massive effect on American society and was much more notable than his death which, while still obviously deserving of mention, is not the overall focus of that article. With Politkovskaya it's the other way, so the article should be weighted accordingly, with the greater emphasis placed on her death.\n:::Does that make more sense?\n::::Yes, sure. I will simply try to add more material about her work sometimes in the future, and if you will have any objections, I think we can find a compromise.\n==Quotes==", "parent_id": "132064855.53343.53343", "replyTo_id": null, "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_REMOVAL", "id": "163484359.0.10050", "rev_id": "163484359"}

If we accept a particular source as reputable then we are implictly saying that its allegations, assertions, etc., are worthy of inclusion in our article without further question, i.e. they don't need to provide evidence to support their own claims. If every source required such a high standard of proof then we'd have to throw out almost every reference on Wikipedia that isn't from a science journal!\n:::Now, if you would like to add a source that expands on her apparent criticism of \"the brutal tactics of the terrorists\" then by all means do so, since it will improve the article. But it doesn't make sense to question whether she ever engaged in such criticism just because the source used doesn't provide proof of that itself. The whole point in the reputability of a source is that we can assume that the journalist did their homework and that what they are saying is accurate. The kind of questioning you're suggesting is only necessary for sources that are inherently untrustworthy.\n::::I agree with the point you are making and I did remove the fact mark there, if you noticed. Mainly for the reason that the sentence identifies the claim as a claim and not as a fact.\n::::I just noticed your edit of the Echo of Moscow account of the demonstrations. You use the same logic there as you describe above and it doesn't make sense for the same reason I just described: by accepting that the source in question is okay for inclusion, we are also accepting that its claims do not require further corroboration, therefore there is no need to add {{fact}} tags to the claim of \"between a few hundred and three thousand\". The source is already there to back up that claim - that's the whole point of such references on Wikipedia in the first place.\n:::::Here I do not agree with you - I do not believe Echo of Moscow to be a reliable source. I therefore think that in this case it is necessary to present a source claiming 3000 attendees, which I am not sure exists (partially because I've spoken to witnesses online, who did not confirm the numbers of a thousand). Furthermore, we have IHT, a reliable source giving exact figure, contradicting claim of 3000 people. I shall return the fact mark there for this reason. I also believe that it might be a good idea to remove Echo of Moscow quote, due to such inconsistency, which I am however leaving at your disposal, to avoid my bias.\n::::::I'd be interested to know why you don't think EoM is reliable enough, particularly on such a non-contentious claim as this one. I don't listen to the radio broadcasts but the website functions simply as a basic newswire - it doesn't really make contentious claims on any subject. Also, I think it's worth noting that its majority owner is Gazprom, which is itself mostly state-owned. In other words, if there is significant bias one would expect it to be slanted in favor of the Russian government.\n::::::However, biased or not, this is all secondary to the main issue: if you have good reason to think the information given is poor then by all means change it and reference to a superior source (the IHT is not bad, in my opinion, but there are much better sources out there). Perhaps this is just my opinion but I really don't like it when editors add {{fact}} tags to anything which they, personally, don't like the sound of. It makes articles look messy and less authoritative. It's much better to simply edit the article.\n:::::::I consider EoM to be unreliable due to its strong political bias, it would however be irrelevant, have we not a (better) source, giving much more precise figures. It is in either case better to have that rather that \"from various sources claims exist\" etc statements. I obviously think that 3000 is a figure strongly exaggerated, which is often the case with media coverage of Russian events by anti-government channels and pretty much any Western media. I made a respective edit - will see now if it is still there as I put it with sourced evidence (the article is in flux all the time).\nFirst, the public letter: no, not the Kadet's e-mails. It was a bunch of military officers who wrote a letter to a Russian paper. Don't remember details right now, someone else maybe does.\nYou should maybe write this review (for example): \"Indeed, there are many more passages which point to this contradictory stance: for example, condemnation of Putin\u2019s use of force, paired with blanket categorization of Chechnya\u2019s democratically elected leaders as \u2018bandits\u2019. (If they\u2019re simply bandits, why not use force?)\"  Yeah, totally pro-separatist stance.\nAP quote (wrote before the current war):\nThese women speak with a decisiveness and clarity that we have long forgotten: \u2018Basayev is a bloodthirsty bandit and traitor and he has no place among normal people.\u2019 (...) Yet again they\u2019ll do nothing about Basayev and swallow this disgrace. Then they\u2019ll shield themselves behind clever words: discussion of the status of Chechnya has been \u2018postponed\u2019, we must not increase tension by arresting Basayev. Madness. The women are right.\nQuite hawkish even, eh?\nDuring the war (when she goes to negotiate with the terrorists in Moscow):\nWhile his \u201cbrother\u201d goes back and forth, Bakar explains how noble the Chechens holding hostages are. There are so many beautiful young girls here in their power (Masha is really a striking beauty), but they just do not have any desire, since they have committed all their energy to the cause of freeing their land. As I understand him, I should be grateful because he did not rape Masha. (...) All of a sudden, the bandits get very nervous. They raise their voices and pace the theater. A hostage cries from upstairs, \u201cPlease bring some first aid kits and disinfectants. We need them badly. Please!\u201d He is chased away. I ask for permission to bring them, but get a resolute \u201cno\u201d in response.\nDo you even have any idea on Politkovskaya, or are you one of these who only try to discredit her as \"anti-Russian American\" (or what not)?

However, this consensus did not result in re-phrasing or putting quotation marks around the paragraphs.  Besides, this transforms a POV into the Wikipedia editorial.  I suggest that just following the letter of Wikipedia policies would greatly reduce the tension between editors.\n: Questioning Arutunyan's article's reliability is another issue.  For example, Arutunyan states that Politkovskaya admitted she never saw the pits.  Politkovskaya never made such an admission.  But this kind of issues is secondary to what we have right now, where Arutunan's paragraphs are presented as Wikipedia's editorial.  It's the violation of Arutunyan's copyright and the lack of attributing her POV to her article that seems an important issue to me.\n:: This Arutunyan - if there was no such statement at all at the \"conference in Moscow\" as you say, this should be either deleted altogether or clearly marked as false rumour (to put it mildly). Also, Lost Angel's still trying (too) hard - one would wonder how the Russian article looks like (I guess I can imagine). Oh, and a possible confusion because she first heard from the witness, and then went to see to the local Russian base.\n: Thanks for finding the exact reference to the mentioning of the earlier Politkovskaya's article on Cadet.

When terrorists held an auditorium hostage during the Nov. 2002 production of Nord-Ost, she spoke to the hostage takers and made their demands public. In Sept. 2004, terrorist in the Beslan school siege had also demanded her presence.\nAgainst this backdrop, it would seem that despite a brave and sincere commitment to unraveling corruption and atrocities wherever possible, Politkovskaya's priorities as a journalist focused more on accusing and less on reporting. But this can be said of many Russian journalists working today. \"Politkovskaya's role in national journalism was rather strange,\" writes political observer Oleg Kashin in a Vzglyad magazine column. \"She was not a representative of Russia's journalistic community.... She was a newsmaker, not a journalist.\"\n:: Besides, the phrase on Politkovskaya's \"unwillingness to check the facts\" with the reference to Arutunyan's article is misleading.  Arutunyan did not make such a statement.

As I see it there are three main problems:\nLength - it's way too long and dwells on minutiae that are not appropriate for a biography of a person who is really not at all well known in the English-speaking world.\nReliability - its use of source material is shoddy at best and a severe POV problem at worst.\nQuality - the standard of writing is, in general, pretty horrible (in part because of the previous two factors).\nThe most immediate problem is the use of source material. It has become obvious that several editors have little interest in improving the article according to established Wikipedia standards and are instead simply trying to make it conform to their personal opinion of Politkovskaya. It is clear that the reliability of sources is being questioned simply because the editors questioning them don't like what those sources are saying. At the same time, it appears that source material is being inserted simply because the editor likes what the text says about Politkovskaya, without regard as to whether or not the source is sufficiently reputable, or whether or not the text is sufficiently notable. The overall impression given - from the way the article is being edited and from the discussions on this page - is that several editors are using the article as a battleground to defend their POV and to attack any appearance of a contrary POV.\n:This must stop.\nThe purpose of editing any Wikipedia article should simply be to improve it. The more contentious the topic the more difficult it is to make improvements. However, if we conform to certain agreed upon standards then such improvements are certainly possible. Accordingly, I propose the following:\n* All editors should start from the position of wanting to make the article better, rather than attempting to make the text conform to their personal opinion of Politkovskaya. In doing so, they must accept the fact that their view of her and her work may not always be accurate, and that notable information from reputable sources should stay in the article even if it contradicts those personal opinions.\n* No source should be questioned purely on the basis that it does not provide evidence of the claims it is making. To suggest that it should is to entirely misunderstand how journalism works.\n* All editors should refrain from using inherently dubious sources (e.g. blogs, barely-known news outlets, government-controlled media, etc.).\n* Any text that is inserted, or any contentious assertion that is made, should be backed up by at least two reputable sources (e.g. major national newspapers, international news wires, etc.).\nThat last suggestion should help in two ways: it should limit the amount of obviously biased assertions in the article and it should also limit the amount of non-notable information and thus make the article more useful to the reader. Let's face it: if a particular assertion doesn't appear at least twice in the respectable press then it almost certainly isn't notable enough for a Wikipedia article!\nThoughts?", "parent_id": "132630790.30237.30237", "replyTo_id": null, "indentation": 0, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_REMOVAL", "id": "163484680.0.2047", "rev_id": "163484680"}

The reporter acknowledged that two different passports with Abubakar's photo had been found among the bodies of the hostage-takers after Russian commandos stormed the theater.

{"user_id": "784547", "user_text": "Disavian", "timestamp": "2007-10-10T02:58:20Z", "content": "\nFound something:\nAmong the terrorist leaders at Dubrovka had been an Arab named \"Yasir,\" a \"subject of Saudi Arabia\" and leader of Al-Qaeda (utro.ru, 30 October 2002). It soon emerged, however, that \"Yasir\" was but another name for \"Abubakar\" (real name: Ruslan Elmurzaev), an ethnic Chechen and the de facto leader of the hostage takers. According to an article by Aleksandr Khinshtein in the May 23 issue of Moskovsky komsomolets this mysterious figure had managed, somehow, to leave the theater before it was stormed by Russian commandosand that the authorities have shown a striking lack of zeal in pursuing him. Russian procurators proved unable to show Elmurzaev's corpse and, during a visit to Chechnya in October 2003, Russian intelligence officers there confirmed to film director Sergei Govorukhin (son of a well-known Duma deputy and filmmaker), who served as one of the volunteer negotiators at Dubrovka where he met Elmurzaev and whom he identified as an FSB agent, that Elmurzaev is alive and living in Chechnya (ruskur.ru, 23 October 2003). This Elmurzaev was said to be the key figure behind several other terrorist attacks in Moscow as well. Among other things, according to informations supplied to Khinshtein by investigators, the name \"Abubakar\" emerges also in relation with a car-bomb attack on a McDonald's restaurant in southwestern Moscow only few days earlier to the Dubrovka siege. The \"main hero\" among these investigators was Yevgeny Taratorin who however was removed from his position by the procuracy which opened a criminal investigation against him for allegedly revealing secrets from the investigation.[4e] Elmurzaev was reported by a former FSB lieutenant colonel turned lawyer, Mikhail Trepashkin. Trepashkin recalled that he had alerted the FSB in the period of late July and early August 2002 to the activities of Elmurzaev and others but had been informed that the FSB \"was aware of the information\" (chechenpress.com, 21 and 31 July 2003). Moreover, as a member of public inquiry committee into explosions in Moscow in 1999, Trepashkin found evidences of the ties between the FSB and the authors of this terrorist act.[4eb] At this point Trepashkin was immediately arrested by the FSB on 22 October 2003. A trial for \"revealing a state secret,\" is now getting under way in the Military Collegium of the Russian Supreme Court.[4f] Trepashkin was asked by an independent State Duma commission to investigate the bombings in the summer of 2002. The commission was formed by then-deputies Yuly Rybakov, Sergei Yushenkov, Sergei Kovalyov, Yury Shchekochikhin and Otto Latsis. Today Trepashkin has been arrested, Yushenkov was shot dead, Shchekochikhin died in unclear circumstances because of a food poisoning and Latsis (also editor of the newspaper Russky Kurer) was beaten unconscious in his apartment building's elevator. Kovalyov and Rybakov are still in circulation but have been accurately expunged from politics by the state media and failed to win re-election to the Duma in the December 2003 parliamentarian elections.\nAnd so:\nThere was at least one terrorist, however, whose body was not found among the others. This was Ruslan Elmurzaev, alias Abubakar, who like \"The Colonel\" at Beslan had been in de facto control of events and who escaped at their conclusion. Abubakar was, the evidence suggests, an FSB \"plant\" and double agent who was rewarded for the success of the operation with his life and, presumably, other consideration.\nSo, not mistake after all.\nAnd Kavkaz Center to the boot:\nIn the result of this investigation a certain Abubakar (or Elmurzaev Ruslan) who allegedly worked in the occupation structure, Leninsky District Department of Internal Affairs (so-called ROVD), and as it has turned out he has served directing and organising role in the kidnapping.\nThe relatives of the kidnapped and killed kids have bought the checked information for a lot of money from Yusupov Ruslan, the former officer of the Soviet and afterwards Russian Army. He confirmed that Elmurzaev Ruslan along with the Chief Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defense of Russia (so-called GRU) was involved in kidnapping of young Chechens aiming at getting their internal organs for following sale.\nThe relatives of the killed unhappy kids have established that firstly officers of GRU brought their victims to Khankala and then tortured them in the basement of service house.\nIt was turned out that as far back as 2002 this Abubakar betrayed his brothers to Russian occupants. Adam Ugurchiev, the relative of kidnapped and killed boys, has confirmed this information.

However, no one was carrying out any checking, since the shadowy funds were also being disseminated to several leaders of the [Russian] power structures. The Hotel Salyut was headed by two Chechens,... but their deputy was [retired] Lieutenant General of the USSR KGB Bogantsev. For this reason, no one [among the authorities] was laying a hand on 'Abubakar' in the hotel.\" Following the Dubrovka incident, Trepashkin voluntarily turned over the information he had collected concerning \"Abubakar\" to the FSB, but the FSB reacted to this gesture by \"trying to fabricate a criminal case against me.\"\nIn a later statement, dated 20 July 2003, Trespashkin added: \"At the end of July-August 2002,... I received information about a concentration in the city of Moscow of armed Chechen extremists....

And, the second point is that we really carry out our own investigation, we really very closely cooperate with the investigators.\nIn August 30, 2007, journalists of [WIKI_LINK: Novaya Gazeta] and son of Anna Ilya Politkovskiy have issued a statement about the ongoing investigation. In it they have claimed that not all involved people were arrested; as well as the Prosecutor's Office has yet to do lots of routine work to prove the guilt of those arrested, however Novaya Gazeta's own investigation shows that \"arrested people were really involved in this crime in this or that degree\".\n:First, it\u2019s not all involved who are arrested.\n:Second, the guilt of those arrested is to be proved. Our own investigation done allows us to assume that the arrested people were really involved in this crime in this or that degree, but the prosecutors will have to do a lot of routine work: interrogations, confrontations and additional searches. It\u2019s not today or this year that the trial will be held.\nThe major issue addressed by journalists of Novaya Gazeta was the leak organized in the media, which has seriously complicated the work of investigators and could let other involved people escape. According to the journalists, \"It seems that someone had a wish to make the currents list of suspected to be final and, besides, not to let solving other crimes that could possibly have been done by the arrested.\"\n:Fourth, and the main, the leak organized in the media because someone had a wish to gain something and someone wanted to prevent investigation to establish all the circumstances of the contract murder of the journalist, this leak has complicated the whole situation. ... Now those people can guess the main direction of the investigation and have opportunities to escape.\nDetails of the investigation were kept in secret for almost ten months, that being controlled by the chief of official investigative group and journalists of [WIKI_LINK: Novaya Gazeta] on their side. In August 27, Prosecutor General and special service officers held press-conferences. Although that wasn't a major breech in the secrecy of the case (besides one of the arrested, [WIKI_LINK: lieutenant colonel] of [WIKI_LINK: FSB] Pavel Ryaguzov, being named), it triggered a snowball of journalist publications and official appearances. Two things had worsened the deal \u2014 at first, as Sergey Sokolov has mentioned in September 2 interview, \"each office had people who had obtained a bit of information \u2014 and they started to sell it to journalists\", the second thing was seeming involvement of some people in these structures, due to \"interpenetration of crime and law enforcement bodies\", internal intrigues and fear that if investigators \"unraveled this tangle, then the details of many celebrated unsolved cases would be disclosed\".\n:After disclosing the name of the arrested special service officer the information just burst out. Different versions of the list of arrested, photofit picture of the conjectured killer, video records made by video cameras at the entrance to the block of flats on Lesnaya Street and the photos of chief of investigative group Pyotr Garibyan appeared in abundance in the Internet.

Well written?: The article is written in clear and understandable language.  However, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD] please merge and condense the lead into no more than 4 paragraphs.\n:2. Factually accurate?: Cited well throughout the article to an impressive (61) good [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] sources.  However, there are a couple portions where I could tell the cite was also pointing to further down in a subsection, but you should take care to actually place the same cite at the end of that paragraph if that is the case.\n:3. Broad in coverage?: Article is very thorough and covers a wide range of topics, both with respect to chronology and the controversial issues involved.\n:4. Neutral point of view?: Appears to be written in neutrally worded language.\n:5. Article stability? I see some edit conflicts and heated discussions, but I had to go back to the last archive to see that, from over four months ago.  Looking at the article history in the past month, unfortunately it does look like there have been some issues of disagreement.  However, there have not been significant revert wars or large changes during that same time period.  Please do keep an eye on this, and keep in mind [WIKI_LINK: WP:CIVIL], and discuss issues on the talk page if/as they come up, and not in the edit histories.\n:6. Images?: 2 images, one from [WIKI_LINK: Wikimedia Commons], the other copyrighted but allowed use for any purpose provided credit is given.\nIf you feel that this review is in error, feel free to take it to [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Good article reassessment|Good article reassessment].

Oh, I'd leave Againstdisrinformation's comments stand without responding to them.\n:::::::::::Here's the problem. Almost every source mentions this was done Putin's birthday. Omitting that from the article, when every single source does it, constitutes misrepresenting sources. So we say that it was \"a fact remarked on in many sources\". So far so good. Now, you insist that we must also say WHY these many sources bring up this fact. Well, that's essentially original research since it asks us to guess what the sources were thinking when they made that choice, which isn't our job as Wikipedians. But ok. Why do the sources bring that up? Or more pertinently, do they really \"disagree on what it means\"? Actually no, not really. The only real disagreement in the sources about this is whether it was done on Putin's birthday because he ordered it, or because someone was trying to kiss up to him independently. There might be a source out there which considers it a pure coincidence. So to speculate and mischaracterize the sources (\"they disagree\") is a problem. That's actually why it is better to just say that sources note that fact. Unless of course you want to say \"She was killed on Putin's birthday, a fact remarked on in many sources which suggest that it implicates Putin or one of his supporters in the murder\". That would be more accurate and no more original research than your wording.\n::::::::Actually, two sources I quoted do claim that the hit was almost certainly ordered by Putin.

Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].

Should this discussion be closed in that manner, and the material re-inserted in the article as a result, I, of course, will not revert it, per the conditions of my unblock, but I will seriously consider bringing the issue to ArbCom for an examination of the actions of all the editors involved, the advocates, the admin who blocked me, and myself.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced''' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n== ", "parent_id": "686226161.27593.27593", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686227398.27593.27593", "rev_id": "686227398"}

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently is a bad idea because they do not really know the subject, even if they read something about it in newspapers or wikipedia pages. Therefore, a consensus on specific page may be a better indicator.\n===RfC===\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n===RfC===\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\"'' - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n== ", "parent_id": "686269766.27593.27593", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686274990.27593.27593", "rev_id": "686274990"}

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n===RfC===\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\"'' - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n== ", "parent_id": "686274990.27593.27593", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686283961.27369.27369", "rev_id": "686283961"}

And, the second point is that we really carry out our own investigation, we really very closely cooperate with the investigators.\nIn August 30, 2007, journalists of [WIKI_LINK: Novaya Gazeta] and son of Anna Ilya Politkovskiy have issued a statement about the ongoing investigation. In it they have claimed that not all involved people were arrested; as well as the Prosecutor's Office has yet to do lots of routine work to prove the guilt of those arrested, however Novaya Gazeta's own investigation shows that \"arrested people were really involved in this crime in this or that degree\".\n:First, it\u2019s not all involved who are arrested.\n:Second, the guilt of those arrested is to be proved. Our own investigation done allows us to assume that the arrested people were really involved in this crime in this or that degree, but the prosecutors will have to do a lot of routine work: interrogations, confrontations and additional searches. It\u2019s not today or this year that the trial will be held.\nThe major issue addressed by journalists of Novaya Gazeta was the leak organized in the media, which has seriously complicated the work of investigators and could let other involved people escape. According to the journalists, \"It seems that someone had a wish to make the currents list of suspected to be final and, besides, not to let solving other crimes that could possibly have been done by the arrested.\"\n:Fourth, and the main, the leak organized in the media because someone had a wish to gain something and someone wanted to prevent investigation to establish all the circumstances of the contract murder of the journalist, this leak has complicated the whole situation. ... Now those people can guess the main direction of the investigation and have opportunities to escape.\nDetails of the investigation were kept in secret for almost ten months, that being controlled by the chief of official investigative group and journalists of [WIKI_LINK: Novaya Gazeta] on their side. In August 27, Prosecutor General and special service officers held press-conferences. Although that wasn't a major breech in the secrecy of the case (besides one of the arrested, [WIKI_LINK: lieutenant colonel] of [WIKI_LINK: FSB] Pavel Ryaguzov, being named), it triggered a snowball of journalist publications and official appearances. Two things had worsened the deal \u2014 at first, as Sergey Sokolov has mentioned in September 2 interview, \"each office had people who had obtained a bit of information \u2014 and they started to sell it to journalists\", the second thing was seeming involvement of some people in these structures, due to \"interpenetration of crime and law enforcement bodies\", internal intrigues and fear that if investigators \"unraveled this tangle, then the details of many celebrated unsolved cases would be disclosed\".\n:After disclosing the name of the arrested special service officer the information just burst out. Different versions of the list of arrested, photofit picture of the conjectured killer, video records made by video cameras at the entrance to the block of flats on Lesnaya Street and the photos of chief of investigative group Pyotr Garibyan appeared in abundance in the Internet. All possible has been done to prevent investigation and to provide the lawyers of the suspected with a good line of defense. For ten months before there had been no serious leak which was a very rare phenomena in our modern practice. The chief of official investigative group was controlling that from his side and we were controlling it from ours.\n:\u0414\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u2013 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u2013 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0440\u0430\u0437. \u041d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u2013 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u2013 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u2013 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0432\u0430. \u0415.\u0410\u041b\u042c\u0411\u0410\u0426: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u044b \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e? \u0417\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438? \u0421.\u0421\u041e\u041a\u041e\u041b\u041e\u0412: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c.\n:This is interpenetration of crime and law enforcement bodies that Anna wrote about many times.

This is how the article, as of October 21, 2007, compares against the  [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:What is a good article?|six good article criteria]:\n:1. Well written?: The article is written in clear and understandable language.  However, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD] please merge and condense the lead into no more than 4 paragraphs.\n:2. Factually accurate?: Cited well throughout the article to an impressive (61) good [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] sources.  However, there are a couple portions where I could tell the cite was also pointing to further down in a subsection, but you should take care to actually place the same cite at the end of that paragraph if that is the case.\n:3. Broad in coverage?: Article is very thorough and covers a wide range of topics, both with respect to chronology and the controversial issues involved.\n:4. Neutral point of view?: Appears to be written in neutrally worded language.\n:5. Article stability? I see some edit conflicts and heated discussions, but I had to go back to the last archive to see that, from over four months ago.  Looking at the article history in the past month, unfortunately it does look like there have been some issues of disagreement.  However, there have not been significant revert wars or large changes during that same time period.  Please do keep an eye on this, and keep in mind [WIKI_LINK: WP:CIVIL], and discuss issues on the talk page if/as they come up, and not in the edit histories.\n:6. Images?: 2 images, one from [WIKI_LINK: Wikimedia Commons], the other copyrighted but allowed use for any purpose provided credit is given.\nIf you feel that this review is in error, feel free to take it to [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Good article reassessment|Good article reassessment].

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n===RfC===\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\"'' - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n== ", "parent_id": "686283961.27369.27369", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686285721.18772.18772", "rev_id": "686285721"}

Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling.

BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.

You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.

Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want?

Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that.

That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article.

It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.

Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.

As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy.

So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\".

We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n===RfC===\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n**Please note that BMK has promised to refrain from editing this article as a condition for an unblock, after they made eight reverts in less than 24 hours, with six of those in less than an hour. They really should not be voting here.\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]).

Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n===RfC===\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n**Please note that BMK has promised to refrain from editing this article as a condition for an unblock, after they made eight reverts in less than 24 hours, with six of those in less than an hour.

I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.

And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n===RfC===\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n**Please note that BMK has promised to refrain from editing this article as a condition for an unblock, after they made eight reverts in less than 24 hours, with six of those in less than an hour. They really should not be voting here.\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence.

However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include.

I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.

Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN.

Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n===RfC===\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n**Please note that BMK has promised to refrain from editing this article as a condition for an unblock, after they made eight reverts in less than 24 hours, with six of those in less than an hour.

If you have any doubts about the specifics of the unblock condition, I suggest you check with the unblocking admin.  In the absence of confirmation that your suppositions are correct, I would appreciate your ceasing to promulgate them, as you have done in multiple venues.\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.

However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include.

As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here.

We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.

We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n===RfC===\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n**Please note that BMK has promised to refrain from editing this article as a condition for an unblock, after they made eight reverts in less than 24 hours, with six of those in less than an hour. They really should not be voting here.\n***Sorry to make the obvious point that the talk page is not the same as the article, and that my unblovk condition was not that I should refrain from editing the article or the talk page, but that I should refrain from edit-warring on the article. If you have any doubts about the specifics of the unblock condition, I suggest you check with the unblocking admin.  In the absence of confirmation that your suppositions are correct, I would appreciate your ceasing to promulgate them, as you have done in multiple venues.\n****Let me repeat what I wrote on the BLPN thread concerning this issue: OK, here's the bottom line: you obviously feel that I've transgressed against the unblock conditions that were imposed on me, so I suggest that you go to the blocking admin, lay out your argument, and ask them to warn or reblock me. If the unblocking admin declines to do that, take it to another admin and ask them to do it. If that admin declines, take it to AN/I and ask the community to sanction me for not following the unblock conditions. If all that fails, then please drop the matter. While you are pursuing all these possible remedies, I'd appreciate it if you'd shut up about it, because it's not relevant to the discussion of whether the material in question is a BLP violation or not, which is the subject of this thread.\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence.

Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n== ", "parent_id": "686484841.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686485168.18320.18320", "rev_id": "686485168"}

Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces .

That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n**Please note that BMK has promised to refrain from editing this article as a condition for an unblock, after they made eight reverts in less than 24 hours, with six of those in less than an hour. They really should not be voting here.\n***Sorry to make the obvious points that the talk page is not the same as the article, and that my unblovk condition was not that I should refrain from editing the article or the talk page, but that I should refrain from edit-warring on the article. If you have any doubts about the specifics of the unblock condition, I suggest you check with the unblocking admin.  In the absence of confirmation that your suppositions are correct, I would appreciate your ceasing to promulgate them, as you have done in multiple venues.\n****Let me repeat what I wrote on the BLPN thread concerning this issue: OK, here's the bottom line: you obviously feel that I've transgressed against the unblock conditions that were imposed on me, so I suggest that you go to the blocking admin, lay out your argument, and ask them to warn or reblock me. If the unblocking admin declines to do that, take it to another admin and ask them to do it. If that admin declines, take it to AN/I and ask the community to sanction me for not following the unblock conditions. If all that fails, then please drop the matter. While you are pursuing all these possible remedies, I'd appreciate it if you'd shut up about it, because it's not relevant to the discussion of whether the material in question is a BLP violation or not, which is the subject of this thread.\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK.

That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article.

Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991).

The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.

If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to supported by a reliable source stating the scope.

Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces .

That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV.

On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday.

Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.

I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright.

The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.

Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\n== ", "parent_id": "686565314.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686565853.18320.18320", "rev_id": "686565853"}

The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.

You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.

Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want?

Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright.

The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n== ", "parent_id": "686585245.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686670794.18320.18320", "rev_id": "686670794"}

(Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday.

You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.

Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n== ", "parent_id": "686673543.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686678069.18320.18320", "rev_id": "686678069"}

If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include.

You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.

Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.

[WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991).

I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV.

()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n== ", "parent_id": "686730294.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686735147.18320.18320", "rev_id": "686735147"}

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.

We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.

That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.

This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it.

Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n== ", "parent_id": "686743926.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "686748363.18320.18320", "rev_id": "686748363"}

(Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case.

For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces .

That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n== ", "parent_id": "686926969.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "687016545.18320.18320", "rev_id": "687016545"}

Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced' \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n== ", "parent_id": "687016545.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "687955823.18320.18320", "rev_id": "687955823"}

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors.

Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces .

That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article.

BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.

Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!).

The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact'.\n== ", "parent_id": "688051443.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "688051481.18320.18320", "rev_id": "688051481"}

Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact'.\n:::It doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention she was killed on Putin's Birthday, it's still trivial. It would be just as trivial if you mentioned Fanni Kaplan  attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin on the day of her birth 50 years before. Only with context it is not trivial. In context you would mention the conspiracy theory. It's not relevant if we know that this conspiracy theory is untrue, it's only relevant that we do not know if it is true. We don't record the obama birther conspiracy because we know it's untrue, we record it because we know that it is notable. We record conspiracy theories related to the Chappaquiddick incident that we neither know as true or untrue. If this conspiracy theory is notable, that is if it would merit an article of it's own, then the birthday along with the conspiracy theory would have some place in the article. Context is everything. POV, Mentioning this birthday attempting to subtlety lead people to believe that putin had something to do with the death. NPOV, Mentioning the conspiracy theory, balanced, and outside of wikipedia voice to neither give it weight as either true or false.\n== ", "parent_id": "688051481.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "688284064.18320.18320", "rev_id": "688284064"}

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors.

Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n*Support inclusion. Summoned by RfC bot. Worth a couple of sentences.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject.

And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want?

Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n*Support inclusion. Summoned by RfC bot. Worth a couple of sentences.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact'.\n:::It doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention she was killed on Putin's Birthday, it's still trivial. It would be just as trivial if you mentioned Fanni Kaplan  attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin on the day of her birth 50 years before. Only with context it is not trivial. In context you would mention the conspiracy theory. It's not relevant if we know that this conspiracy theory is untrue, it's only relevant that we do not know if it is true. We don't record the obama birther conspiracy because we know it's untrue, we record it because we know that it is notable. We record conspiracy theories related to the Chappaquiddick incident that we neither know as true or untrue. If this conspiracy theory is notable, that is if it would merit an article of it's own, then the birthday along with the conspiracy theory would have some place in the article. Context is everything. POV, Mentioning this birthday attempting to subtlety lead people to believe that putin had something to do with the death. NPOV, Mentioning the conspiracy theory, balanced, and outside of wikipedia voice to neither give it weight as either true or false.\n::::What do you mean \"it doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention\" it? What Wikipedia policy did you pull that out of? It's NOT trivial. How do we know it's not trivial? Because every freakin' source mentions it. YOU don't get to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not. Sources do.\n::::It's not that hard. Just follow Wikipedia policy rather than the fancies of your own imagination.\n== ", "parent_id": "689343421.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "689343461.18320.18320", "rev_id": "689343461"}

[WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991).

I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n*Support inclusion. Summoned by RfC bot. Worth a couple of sentences.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact'.\n:::It doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention she was killed on Putin's Birthday, it's still trivial. It would be just as trivial if you mentioned Fanni Kaplan  attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin on the day of her birth 50 years before. Only with context it is not trivial. In context you would mention the conspiracy theory. It's not relevant if we know that this conspiracy theory is untrue, it's only relevant that we do not know if it is true. We don't record the obama birther conspiracy because we know it's untrue, we record it because we know that it is notable. We record conspiracy theories related to the Chappaquiddick incident that we neither know as true or untrue. If this conspiracy theory is notable, that is if it would merit an article of it's own, then the birthday along with the conspiracy theory would have some place in the article. Context is everything. POV, Mentioning this birthday attempting to subtlety lead people to believe that putin had something to do with the death. NPOV, Mentioning the conspiracy theory, balanced, and outside of wikipedia voice to neither give it weight as either true or false.\n::::What do you mean \"it doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention\" it? What Wikipedia policy did you pull that out of? It's NOT trivial. How do we know it's not trivial? Because every freakin' source mentions it. YOU don't get to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not. Sources do.\n::::It's not that hard. Just follow Wikipedia policy rather than the fancies of your own imagination.\n:::::Nearly all sources not simply mention this fact, but explicitly claim an actual connection - based on analysis of other factual information related to the case. According to Putin, that was done by his enemies abroad to upset him. According to independent experts, that was done by his friends to please him.

As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.

As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation.

Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\".

We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion.

I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.

I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.

Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.

Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact'.\n:::It doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention she was killed on Putin's Birthday, it's still trivial. It would be just as trivial if you mentioned Fanni Kaplan  attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin on the day of her birth 50 years before. Only with context it is not trivial. In context you would mention the conspiracy theory. It's not relevant if we know that this conspiracy theory is untrue, it's only relevant that we do not know if it is true. We don't record the obama birther conspiracy because we know it's untrue, we record it because we know that it is notable. We record conspiracy theories related to the Chappaquiddick incident that we neither know as true or untrue. If this conspiracy theory is notable, that is if it would merit an article of it's own, then the birthday along with the conspiracy theory would have some place in the article. Context is everything. POV, Mentioning this birthday attempting to subtlety lead people to believe that putin had something to do with the death. NPOV, Mentioning the conspiracy theory, balanced, and outside of wikipedia voice to neither give it weight as either true or false.\n::::What do you mean \"it doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention\" it? What Wikipedia policy did you pull that out of? It's NOT trivial. How do we know it's not trivial? Because every freakin' source mentions it. YOU don't get to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not. Sources do.\n::::It's not that hard. Just follow Wikipedia policy rather than the fancies of your own imagination.\n:::::Nearly all sources not simply mention this fact, but explicitly claim an actual connection - based on analysis of other factual information related to the case. According to Putin, that was done by his enemies abroad to upset him. According to independent experts, that was done by his friends to please him. But according to nearly all sources, these events are actually connected.\n:::::It means that it doesn't matter how many reliable sources you have to say she was killed on Putin's birthday because this in itself is trivial. You can grasp at straws because you lack an actual argument and ignore the rest of what I have said. You want to put it in the article? Cool! That's fine. Make it non-trivial. How do you do this? Context. There is a context in which Putin's birthday becomes highly relevant. The unproven accusations, the multiple and highly notable unproven accusations. Now there's whole need to handle with care. If these independent experts for instance mentioned by My very best Wishes haven't proven that Putin's friend did it for him as a favor you can't present it as fact. You also present the other side of the coin, Putin's claim that his enemies did it. You also present the other conspiracy theories.\n== ", "parent_id": "689350465.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "689829657.18320.18320", "rev_id": "689829657"}

As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page.

Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV.

Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact'.\n:::It doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention she was killed on Putin's Birthday, it's still trivial. It would be just as trivial if you mentioned Fanni Kaplan  attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin on the day of her birth 50 years before. Only with context it is not trivial. In context you would mention the conspiracy theory. It's not relevant if we know that this conspiracy theory is untrue, it's only relevant that we do not know if it is true. We don't record the obama birther conspiracy because we know it's untrue, we record it because we know that it is notable. We record conspiracy theories related to the Chappaquiddick incident that we neither know as true or untrue. If this conspiracy theory is notable, that is if it would merit an article of it's own, then the birthday along with the conspiracy theory would have some place in the article. Context is everything. POV, Mentioning this birthday attempting to subtlety lead people to believe that putin had something to do with the death. NPOV, Mentioning the conspiracy theory, balanced, and outside of wikipedia voice to neither give it weight as either true or false.\n::::What do you mean \"it doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention\" it? What Wikipedia policy did you pull that out of? It's NOT trivial. How do we know it's not trivial? Because every freakin' source mentions it. YOU don't get to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not. Sources do.\n::::It's not that hard. Just follow Wikipedia policy rather than the fancies of your own imagination.\n:::::Nearly all sources not simply mention this fact, but explicitly claim an actual connection - based on analysis of other factual information related to the case. According to Putin, that was done by his enemies abroad to upset him. According to independent experts, that was done by his friends to please him. But according to nearly all sources, these events are actually connected.\n:::::It means that it doesn't matter how many reliable sources you have to say she was killed on Putin's birthday because this in itself is trivial. You can grasp at straws because you lack an actual argument and ignore the rest of what I have said. You want to put it in the article? Cool! That's fine. Make it non-trivial. How do you do this? Context. There is a context in which Putin's birthday becomes highly relevant. The unproven accusations, the multiple and highly notable unproven accusations. Now there's whole need to handle with care. If these independent experts for instance mentioned by My very best Wishes haven't proven that Putin's friend did it for him as a favor you can't present it as fact. You also present the other side of the coin, Putin's claim that his enemies did it. You also present the other conspiracy theories.\n::::::Again, exactly which Wikipedia policy is it that says that a user named Serialjoepsycho gets to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not? Oh, that's right, none. None Wikipedia policy says that. Whether something is \"trivial\" or not is determined by whether it's mentioned in sources not by your own personal opinion.  You don't like that? Change the policy or find an internet project more amenable to your interest in conducting [WIKI_LINK: WP:OR|original research].\n== ", "parent_id": "689829657.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "689864365.18320.18320", "rev_id": "689864365"}

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n*Support inclusion. Summoned by RfC bot. Worth a couple of sentences.\n* Support a mention that sources have discussed it.  To report it as a fact without any context could very well be a BLP violation.  Conspiracy/fringe theories can be worth noting, as long as we don't promulgate them as if they were the mainstream view.  This needs to be carefully written if it's included.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed.

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n*Support inclusion. Summoned by RfC bot. Worth a couple of sentences.\n* Support a mention that sources have discussed it.  To report it as a fact without any context could very well be a BLP violation.  Conspiracy/fringe theories can be worth noting, as long as we don't promulgate them as if they were the mainstream view.  This needs to be carefully written if it's included.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.

Or perhaps you could stay on this project and give an actual reason that this isn't trivial. And context is not Original research. A two second google search uncovered this source . It talks about Putin's birthday. They also do something crazy and give some actual context to why her death on Putin's birthday is relevant. It's actually very likely that most if not all reliable sources give some kind of context as well. There's not tendency for reliable sources to say \"George was murdered today and the Sky was Blue.\" However the sources have said the Sky was blue and we arguing somehow this is important. It's suggested above that there is a source of Putin coming out on the very subject and addressing it. Context is an amazing thing. With out context you have an article about a woman who was an ardent critic of Putin that ends with BTW she was murdered on Putin's birthday.

{"user_id": "10071161", "user_text": "My very best wishes", "timestamp": "2015-11-10T16:19:05Z", "content": "\n:If no one objects, I am going to place this back. But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n*Support inclusion. Summoned by RfC bot. Worth a couple of sentences.\n* Support a mention that sources have discussed it.  To report it as a fact without any context could very well be a BLP violation.  Conspiracy/fringe theories can be worth noting, as long as we don't promulgate them as if they were the mainstream view.  This needs to be carefully written if it's included.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact'.\n:::It doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention she was killed on Putin's Birthday, it's still trivial. It would be just as trivial if you mentioned Fanni Kaplan  attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin on the day of her birth 50 years before. Only with context it is not trivial. In context you would mention the conspiracy theory. It's not relevant if we know that this conspiracy theory is untrue, it's only relevant that we do not know if it is true. We don't record the obama birther conspiracy because we know it's untrue, we record it because we know that it is notable. We record conspiracy theories related to the Chappaquiddick incident that we neither know as true or untrue. If this conspiracy theory is notable, that is if it would merit an article of it's own, then the birthday along with the conspiracy theory would have some place in the article. Context is everything. POV, Mentioning this birthday attempting to subtlety lead people to believe that putin had something to do with the death. NPOV, Mentioning the conspiracy theory, balanced, and outside of wikipedia voice to neither give it weight as either true or false.\n::::What do you mean \"it doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention\" it? What Wikipedia policy did you pull that out of? It's NOT trivial. How do we know it's not trivial? Because every freakin' source mentions it. YOU don't get to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not. Sources do.\n::::It's not that hard. Just follow Wikipedia policy rather than the fancies of your own imagination.\n:::::Nearly all sources not simply mention this fact, but explicitly claim an actual connection - based on analysis of other factual information related to the case. According to Putin, that was done by his enemies abroad to upset him. According to independent experts, that was done by his friends to please him. But according to nearly all sources, these events are actually connected.\n:::::It means that it doesn't matter how many reliable sources you have to say she was killed on Putin's birthday because this in itself is trivial. You can grasp at straws because you lack an actual argument and ignore the rest of what I have said. You want to put it in the article? Cool! That's fine. Make it non-trivial. How do you do this? Context. There is a context in which Putin's birthday becomes highly relevant. The unproven accusations, the multiple and highly notable unproven accusations. Now there's whole need to handle with care. If these independent experts for instance mentioned by My very best Wishes haven't proven that Putin's friend did it for him as a favor you can't present it as fact. You also present the other side of the coin, Putin's claim that his enemies did it. You also present the other conspiracy theories.\n::::::Again, exactly which Wikipedia policy is it that says that a user named Serialjoepsycho gets to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not? Oh, that's right, none. None Wikipedia policy says that. Whether something is \"trivial\" or not is determined by whether it's mentioned in sources not by your own personal opinion.  You don't like that? Change the policy or find an internet project more amenable to your interest in conducting [WIKI_LINK: WP:OR|original research].\n:::::::Omg that's right. Wikipedia has hard and fast rules. What was I thinking? Oh wait no it actually doesn't. Some things actually left to common sense and editorial judgement. You aren't new so I wonder why you are ignoring this. Is this something that you don't like? There's other projects that you can of course join. Or perhaps you could stay on this project and give an actual reason that this isn't trivial. And context is not Original research. A two second google search uncovered this source . It talks about Putin's birthday. They also do something crazy and give some actual context to why her death on Putin's birthday is relevant. It's actually very likely that most if not all reliable sources give some kind of context as well. There's not tendency for reliable sources to say \"George was murdered today and the Sky was Blue.\" However the sources have said the Sky was blue and we arguing somehow this is important. It's suggested above that there is a source of Putin coming out on the very subject and addressing it. Context is an amazing thing. With out context you have an article about a woman who was an ardent critic of Putin that ends with BTW she was murdered on Putin's birthday. You are left with undue weight without the context and the context can be reliably sourced.\n::::::::Link/source you provided is a perfect example. This is an article in \"Independent\" that provides brief and fair summary of the events. Most other sources tell basically the same. This source did mention the fact and placed it in a certain context, just as most other sources. The only thing we should do is to fairly summarize the content of the sources, that is to mention the fact and to place it in the same context as sources do. There is nothing really to discuss here.\n== ", "parent_id": "689906795.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "689984055.18320.18320", "rev_id": "689984055"}

(Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n*Support inclusion. Summoned by RfC bot. Worth a couple of sentences.\n* Support a mention that sources have discussed it.  To report it as a fact without any context could very well be a BLP violation.  Conspiracy/fringe theories can be worth noting, as long as we don't promulgate them as if they were the mainstream view.  This needs to be carefully written if it's included.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact'.\n:::It doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention she was killed on Putin's Birthday, it's still trivial. It would be just as trivial if you mentioned Fanni Kaplan  attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin on the day of her birth 50 years before. Only with context it is not trivial. In context you would mention the conspiracy theory. It's not relevant if we know that this conspiracy theory is untrue, it's only relevant that we do not know if it is true. We don't record the obama birther conspiracy because we know it's untrue, we record it because we know that it is notable. We record conspiracy theories related to the Chappaquiddick incident that we neither know as true or untrue. If this conspiracy theory is notable, that is if it would merit an article of it's own, then the birthday along with the conspiracy theory would have some place in the article. Context is everything. POV, Mentioning this birthday attempting to subtlety lead people to believe that putin had something to do with the death. NPOV, Mentioning the conspiracy theory, balanced, and outside of wikipedia voice to neither give it weight as either true or false.\n::::What do you mean \"it doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention\" it? What Wikipedia policy did you pull that out of? It's NOT trivial. How do we know it's not trivial? Because every freakin' source mentions it. YOU don't get to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not. Sources do.\n::::It's not that hard. Just follow Wikipedia policy rather than the fancies of your own imagination.\n:::::Nearly all sources not simply mention this fact, but explicitly claim an actual connection - based on analysis of other factual information related to the case. According to Putin, that was done by his enemies abroad to upset him. According to independent experts, that was done by his friends to please him. But according to nearly all sources, these events are actually connected.\n:::::It means that it doesn't matter how many reliable sources you have to say she was killed on Putin's birthday because this in itself is trivial. You can grasp at straws because you lack an actual argument and ignore the rest of what I have said. You want to put it in the article? Cool! That's fine. Make it non-trivial. How do you do this? Context. There is a context in which Putin's birthday becomes highly relevant. The unproven accusations, the multiple and highly notable unproven accusations. Now there's whole need to handle with care. If these independent experts for instance mentioned by My very best Wishes haven't proven that Putin's friend did it for him as a favor you can't present it as fact. You also present the other side of the coin, Putin's claim that his enemies did it. You also present the other conspiracy theories.\n::::::Again, exactly which Wikipedia policy is it that says that a user named Serialjoepsycho gets to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not? Oh, that's right, none. None Wikipedia policy says that. Whether something is \"trivial\" or not is determined by whether it's mentioned in sources not by your own personal opinion.  You don't like that? Change the policy or find an internet project more amenable to your interest in conducting [WIKI_LINK: WP:OR|original research].\n:::::::Omg that's right. Wikipedia has hard and fast rules. What was I thinking? Oh wait no it actually doesn't. Some things actually left to common sense and editorial judgement. You aren't new so I wonder why you are ignoring this. Is this something that you don't like? There's other projects that you can of course join. Or perhaps you could stay on this project and give an actual reason that this isn't trivial. And context is not Original research. A two second google search uncovered this source . It talks about Putin's birthday. They also do something crazy and give some actual context to why her death on Putin's birthday is relevant. It's actually very likely that most if not all reliable sources give some kind of context as well. There's not tendency for reliable sources to say \"George was murdered today and the Sky was Blue.\" However the sources have said the Sky was blue and we arguing somehow this is important. It's suggested above that there is a source of Putin coming out on the very subject and addressing it. Context is an amazing thing. With out context you have an article about a woman who was an ardent critic of Putin that ends with BTW she was murdered on Putin's birthday. You are left with undue weight without the context and the context can be reliably sourced.\n::::::::Link/source you provided is a perfect example. This is an article in \"Independent\" that provides brief and fair summary of the events. Most other sources tell basically the same. This source did mention the fact and placed it in a certain context, just as most other sources. The only thing we should do is to fairly summarize the content of the sources, that is to mention the fact and to place it in the same context as sources do. There is nothing really to discuss here.\n[OUTDENT: 99] precisely.\n== ", "parent_id": "689984055.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "690075484.18320.18320", "rev_id": "690075484"}

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n*Support inclusion. Summoned by RfC bot. Worth a couple of sentences.\n* Support a mention that sources have discussed it.  To report it as a fact without any context could very well be a BLP violation.  Conspiracy/fringe theories can be worth noting, as long as we don't promulgate them as if they were the mainstream view.  This needs to be carefully written if it's included.\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact.\n:::It doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention she was killed on Putin's Birthday, it's still trivial. It would be just as trivial if you mentioned Fanni Kaplan  attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin on the day of her birth 50 years before. Only with context it is not trivial. In context you would mention the conspiracy theory. It's not relevant if we know that this conspiracy theory is untrue, it's only relevant that we do not know if it is true. We don't record the obama birther conspiracy because we know it's untrue, we record it because we know that it is notable. We record conspiracy theories related to the Chappaquiddick incident that we neither know as true or untrue. If this conspiracy theory is notable, that is if it would merit an article of it's own, then the birthday along with the conspiracy theory would have some place in the article. Context is everything. POV, Mentioning this birthday attempting to subtlety lead people to believe that putin had something to do with the death. NPOV, Mentioning the conspiracy theory, balanced, and outside of wikipedia voice to neither give it weight as either true or false.\n::::What do you mean \"it doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention\" it? What Wikipedia policy did you pull that out of? It's NOT trivial. How do we know it's not trivial? Because every freakin' source mentions it. YOU don't get to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not. Sources do.\n::::It's not that hard. Just follow Wikipedia policy rather than the fancies of your own imagination.\n:::::Nearly all sources not simply mention this fact, but explicitly claim an actual connection - based on analysis of other factual information related to the case. According to Putin, that was done by his enemies abroad to upset him. According to independent experts, that was done by his friends to please him. But according to nearly all sources, these events are actually connected.\n:::::It means that it doesn't matter how many reliable sources you have to say she was killed on Putin's birthday because this in itself is trivial. You can grasp at straws because you lack an actual argument and ignore the rest of what I have said. You want to put it in the article? Cool! That's fine. Make it non-trivial. How do you do this? Context. There is a context in which Putin's birthday becomes highly relevant. The unproven accusations, the multiple and highly notable unproven accusations. Now there's whole need to handle with care. If these independent experts for instance mentioned by My very best Wishes haven't proven that Putin's friend did it for him as a favor you can't present it as fact. You also present the other side of the coin, Putin's claim that his enemies did it. You also present the other conspiracy theories.\n::::::Again, exactly which Wikipedia policy is it that says that a user named Serialjoepsycho gets to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not? Oh, that's right, none. None Wikipedia policy says that. Whether something is \"trivial\" or not is determined by whether it's mentioned in sources not by your own personal opinion.  You don't like that? Change the policy or find an internet project more amenable to your interest in conducting [WIKI_LINK: WP:OR|original research].\n:::::::Omg that's right. Wikipedia has hard and fast rules. What was I thinking? Oh wait no it actually doesn't. Some things actually left to common sense and editorial judgement. You aren't new so I wonder why you are ignoring this. Is this something that you don't like? There's other projects that you can of course join. Or perhaps you could stay on this project and give an actual reason that this isn't trivial. And context is not Original research. A two second google search uncovered this source . It talks about Putin's birthday. They also do something crazy and give some actual context to why her death on Putin's birthday is relevant. It's actually very likely that most if not all reliable sources give some kind of context as well. There's not tendency for reliable sources to say \"George was murdered today and the Sky was Blue.\" However the sources have said the Sky was blue and we arguing somehow this is important. It's suggested above that there is a source of Putin coming out on the very subject and addressing it. Context is an amazing thing. With out context you have an article about a woman who was an ardent critic of Putin that ends with BTW she was murdered on Putin's birthday. You are left with undue weight without the context and the context can be reliably sourced.\n::::::::Link/source you provided is a perfect example. This is an article in \"Independent\" that provides brief and fair summary of the events. Most other sources tell basically the same. This source did mention the fact and placed it in a certain context, just as most other sources. The only thing we should do is to fairly summarize the content of the sources, that is to mention the fact and to place it in the same context as sources do. There is nothing really to discuss here.\n[OUTDENT: 99] precisely.\n== ", "parent_id": "690075484.18320.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "692890055.18414.18320", "rev_id": "692890055"}

But a lot more should be improved on this page and many other pages related to human rights in Russia. (Un)fortunately, I do not have time for this, among other things.\n::I object, and will remove the claim if added.  As stated numerous times above, by numerous editors, these are sources for the existence of the claim, which nobody doubts, not for the truth of the implications of the claim.  However much one may dislike him, Putin is a live person, and comes under BLP policy.\n:::No, as was noted already, not telling something that almost all reliable sources on this subject tell (as in current version) is an outright misrepresentation of the sources and goes against [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOV], which is our ruling policy. As was also noted before, you should make a post about this on [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPNB] if you think this is a BLP violation, rather than edit war here. In my opinion, there is no way to treat this as a BLP violation. So, unless you are going to post this matter on BLPNB, I am going to include this info.\n::The source are NOT for the \"existence of the claim\" - that's just false. Those would be sources which state \"such and such claimed that she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". What we have are in fact source which make the claim (which is trivially true) - \"she was murdered on Putin's birthday\". You can read whatever you want into the fact, but that's your business. We simply report what sources say, in a way which is as close to what sources say without actually violating copyright. And there's sixteen sources right there which say it.\n::Please stop misrepresenting sources.\nI'm also extremely annoyed by the fact that BMK 1) refuses to discuss this question in any meaningful way, 2) refuses to address the sources, 3) only comments when reverted and otherwise does not participate in the discussion. This isn't proper Wikipedia behavior. I also think it may be worthwhile to go to an outside venue to discuss this, like [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLPN] (the fact that BMK refused to do this previously sort of suggests that they are aware that they're on shaky ground here).\n:Are you serious?  It's been discussed to death, VM.  There is no evidence of the truth of the matter, just of the existence of the claim.  Until there's some evidence to support the implications, it's BLP violation, and I will delete it. That's the bottom line, and it hasn't changed.\n::So, you do not want to post this matter to BLPNB? Note that according to instruction on BLPNB, (\"Generally this means cases where editors are repeatedly adding defamatory or libelous material to articles\") this is your responsibility to post, because you are the only person who claims BLP violation in this  latest thread (a lot of additional supporting sources have been added recently, which matters).\n::this \"discussion to death\" has involved myself and MVBW presenting sources, over and over again, and you just stone-walling. That's not a discussion. I am very much open to discussing HOW this info should be included but again, for the millionth time, seeing as how almost every single source mentions it, it must be included in some form. Otherwise we are misrepresenting sources.\n::BLP is only violated if the material is unsourced or sourced in a shoddy way. This is not the case here at all.\n:::What can I tell? BMK not only continued edit warring, but posted [EXTERNAL_LINK: a message on my talk page] that is simply untrue because this edit was fully sources to several books by historians, in addition to ~30 sources provided by you above.\n::::Sorry, you're both wasting your time and energy.  The only conceivable reason for wanting to note that the date of the murders was Putin's birthday is to imply a connection between them.  That's a clear BLP violation unless and until there is some evidence  not speculation or theorizing - of a connection.  You have shown numerous sources which speculate or theorize, and none that have shown a connection, so you simply cannot have it in the article.  I understand you hate Putin, I don't like him either, but you cannot bend policy to get in a dig at someone you hate with no evidence to support it.  You don't have it, and it will not go into the article until you do.This is my last comment on this issue.  I will continue to remove BLP violations from the article, which, you'll remember, is immune from edit warring charges, whereas the addition of BLP violations is not.\n:::::I can only repeat that according to WP:BLP, Contentious material about living persons ... that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion. But this is something obviously well-sourced. Therefore, 3RR exemption does not apply. Since you do not want to collect more opinions on WP:BLPNB, perhaps we should ask on [WIKI_LINK: WP:NPOVNB] or make an RfC? But I am not certain we should waste other people's time.\n:::::I concur. We do not accuse Putin in the murder. That is only one phrase: Many sources have noted that she was killed on Vladimir Putin's birthday although these do not necessarily explicitly state the significance of this fact.[49][50][51]. It is well sourced and relevant. I have restored the fragment.\n*We're right back where we were a month ago; I have protected againno doubt it's the WRONG VERSION. Two weeks ought to be enough to figure this out, preferably on BLPN. I'm not the only admin who thinks that the BLP is in fact...let's say challenged here, and it ought to be the burden for the includers to prove that the BLP is not violated: we err on the side of caution, even if the LP in question is a muscular, hockey-playing leader of a world power. Good luck with it.\n::Actually, I think you are the only admin who thinks that. I see two other admins here, but they seem to think otherwise. BMK is not an admin, I don't think. And as far as \"proving\" that BLP is not being violated - well, there's more than 30 sources right up above. What else do you want? This looks like a case where no matter what kind of \"proof\" is presented, in the form of reliable high quality sources, the editor on the other side will just keep on ignoring it. Which is why they were blocked here.\n::Also, you really shouldn't 1) participate in an edit war, 2) unblock other parties to the edit war who agree with you and 3) protect your preferred version of the page. I know that people try to stretch and abuse the definition of [WIKI_LINK: WP:INVOLVED] sometimes, but in this case, I do think you really crossed a line.\n::*, [EXTERNAL_LINK: this one] has some weight to it: these were the same edits.\n:::Simply looking at this article editing history, one can tell that BMK reverted edit made by five contributors. This is obviously a [WIKI_LINK: WP:Consensus] to include this material and consensus that the edit was not a BLP violation.\n:::*We have noticeboards to attract a larger and possibly more...uninvested editors. Consensus on a talk page on BLP matters is much less convincing than consensus reached in a broader forum.\n:::::Inviting \"uninvested editors\" is frequently a bad idea because they do not really know the subject. Therefore, a consensus on specific page between people who actually contributed to the page and related subjects may be a better indicator. I also looked at the page and can see a number of problems. In particular, there is no section which describes journalist investigations by Politkovskaya. For example, while investigating the [WIKI_LINK: Moscow theater hostage crisis], she took an interview from Terkibaev, an FSB agent-provocateur who directed terrorists to the theater and left the building before it was taken by FSB forces . But unfortunately, I do not have time for that. The time was spent on a totally ridiculous discussion that was started by now banned user Againstdisinformation who was supported by some other participants for reasons I do not understand.\n==RfC==\n*Question: should this article describe the connection some observers have drawn between the date of Politkovskaya's murder and the date of Putin's birthday, using some or all of the sources indicated at the top of this section?\n====Support====\n* Of course, it's quite reliably sourced. That's what matters.\n*Yes, sure. This is merely a factoid. Almost every RS on the subject tells about this [WIKI_LINK: fact] as something highly significant. Hence it must be included per WP:NPOV. Not telling something that almost all RS tell would be an outright misrepresentation of sources.\n*Support inclusion in the article. Google search for \"Politkovskaya Putin's birthday\" brings [EXTERNAL_LINK: 16K] hits in English and [EXTERNAL_LINK: 110K] hits in Russian. Among the hits are [EXTERNAL_LINK: The Guardian], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Reuters], [EXTERNAL_LINK: Russia Today], [EXTERNAL_LINK: RFERL],[EXTERNAL_LINK: NewsRu] - I just looked on the first pages of each search. It is absolutely stupid not to include this factoid into the article. On the other hand I am oppose to putting the info in a more prominent location, as indeed the connection is not proven\n*Obviously since almost every single source about her mentions this very fact. If every almost every single source states something it needs to be in the encyclopedia article about the subject. There really should not be any controversy about this.\n*Strong Support 's specious laundry list of other events on the same date is belied by the fact that not one source references a connection to any other event on that October 7 date other than [WIKI_LINK: Vladimir Putin]'s birthday. Our job here is not to establish and prove facts; It is to demonstrate [WIKI_LINK: WP:V|verifiablity]. BMK's persistent demand that we must satisfy his demand for proof indicates a complete and total lack of understanding of what Wikipedia is about. The number of sources that make the connection is overwhelming; the excuses offered to ignore these sources offer no meaningful rebuttal.\n*Support inclusion of this fact. Things that are widely reported in reliable source are not rumours, they're speculation. Rumours are when there's no source.\n*Support for mention of the single observable fact that Politkovskaya was murdered on Putin's birthday, because nearly every single [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS] out of the dozens if not hundreds that exist mention that fact as notable and noteworthy, per [WIKI_LINK: WP:CENSOR]. Possible support for examination of the import of this as speculated/theorized in various media, only if couched in very clear terms as mere speculation, and only if each speculation is directly attributed, in text, to the source of the speculation, and only if the source is unquestionably reliable, neutral, independent, and credible.\n*Support mention of fact  Oppose using the fact to add opinion/speculation as who to ordered any death.\n*Support.  The claim that this is a BLP violation is absurd and I've been appalled by BMK's edit warring based on that claim.  He should have stayed blocked over his bad behavior.  BLP seems intended to protect ordinary living people, not leaders of superpowers like Putin.  More to the point, this isn't an article about Putin, it's about someone else.  My attitude here is that if it's a reliable source  and clearly there are a lot of them  that's all it should take.  We decide content based on reliable sources, not whether BMK is satisfied that this has been proven to be truth.\n* Support - I agree with the above user.  If the information is coming from a reliable source and represents a widely reported fact, then it should be included.  This is not a rumor if it has reliable sources backing it up.  Also - almost every source mentions this so-called relationship.  Cheers,\n* Support. [WIKI_LINK: Anna_Politkovskaya] was killed October 7, wich was the birthday of [WIKI_LINK: Nicole Jung], an American-South Korean singer, dancer, and actress (born October 7, 1991). This is a factual factoid but, guess why, quite nobody is reporting.\n* Conditional Support: should include at least some hedging language (\"some sources noted\"), and perhaps (?) a sourced denial from a credible Russian source. I understand that this is at least potentially BLP, and so I do want to stay well away from that area.\n::This is actually a good point. The fact was so notable and so widely published, that the denial was issued by Putin himself. On 10 October 2006, 2,000 demonstrators called Putin a \"murderer\" during his visit to [WIKI_LINK: Dresden], Germany. Putin replied: \"This journalist was indeed a sharp critic of the present Russian authorities...but the degree of her influence over political life in Russia was extremely insignificant. She was well-known in journalistic circles, among human rights activists, in the West. I repeat, her influence over political life in Russian was minimal.[EXTERNAL_LINK: Chechnya: Politkovskaya Mourned As 'Last Hope'] 11 October 2006 And in my opinion murdering such a person certainly does much greater damage from the authorities' point of view, authorities that she strongly criticized, than her publications ever did.\".\n:::However, including a denial would beg the question, \"What are they denying,\" which would inevitably lead to the assertion that the Russian government was involved... so maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n::::This is basically a fact/claim that has been published everywhere and everyone knows, or at least everyone familiar with the subject. \"Hiding\" that is stupid and goes against WP:NPOV. Something that everyone knows is not going to ruin anyone's reputation any more than it has been already ruined.\n* Meh. Conspiracy theories qualify for inclusion only as long as we have adequate sourecs showing them to be just that: conspiracy theories. I don't think Putin really has people killed to celebrate his birthday.  ()\n::An important and nearly undisputable fact about this is that people who hired the killers were never brought to justice . Hence a number of experts (I mostly mean the books) conducted their own analysis of the case. Some quotations above are not speculations or conspiracy theories, but conclusions by experts; more about this can be found in quoted sources. Most experts agree about the involvement of the \"Chechen leadership\" (meaning Kadyrov) and Russian state security services (FSB) in organizing the assassination - based on people who have been arrested or convicted and other details of the criminal case. However, I think this is not really the question under discussion/voting here. Some of the most recent publications noticed 15 similar features/facts between her case and the recent murder of Nemtsov  (unfortunately, this is a Russian language source).\n*Support  the extent of sourcing on this is so impressive that it's obviously necessary to include it in this article.  (Let's put it this way: not including it is hardly going to make it go away.)  The idea, already evident below, that there's no point in even discussing it because it's a BLP violation is amusing.  In reality, there's no provision of BLP that would be violated by including some careful coverage of this topic.\n*Support, on the conditions described by  above; there is no BLP issue so long as all we do is note that others have made the connection, without saying in Wikipedia's voice that there's anything to it or not.    .\n*Support inclusion, widely mentioned by reliable sources.\n*Support inclusion. Summoned by RfC bot. Worth a couple of sentences.\n* Support a mention that sources have discussed it.  To report it as a fact without any context could very well be a BLP violation.  Conspiracy/fringe theories can be worth noting, as long as we don't promulgate them as if they were the mainstream view.  This needs to be carefully written if it's included.\n* Support, but... not as innuendo in the lede. I support including the fact that she was killed on Putin's birthday for what it is: a fact that is a source of much conjecture about the meaning of her killing. Include it in the body of the article with consideration about weight. To include it in the lede is innuendo and a violation of [WIKI_LINK: WP:UNDUE] and [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP].\n====Oppose====\n*Per my extensive arguments above, what is reliably sourced is the existence or rumors, conjecture, speculation, and conspiracy theorizing.  There is no dispute about that, or about the date of the murder being Putin's birthday.  What is missing, and what is required by BLP policy, is verifiable evidence in reliable sources of any actual real-world connection between the events.  Without such evidence, the implication that Putin is in some way involved, either personally or via the murder being a \"gift\" to him from the murderers, is a gross BLP violation and should not be in the article.In any event, an article talk page discussion may reach a local consensus concerning this issue, but it cannot override BLP policy, so the proper place for this discussion is not here, but at the BLPN thread I started [EXTERNAL_LINK: here].\n::Off topic discussion\n*Agree with BMK here - there is no verifiable causal connection, only verified speculation.  If anything, report that it has been speculated, but the connection should not be made in WP voice. I'd say caution and the conservative principle behind BLP suggest leaving it out.\n*Agree with the oppose. 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born. If some writer [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPECULATTION|speculated] that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either. |\n*worthless factoid  whose single purpose is to attach blame to Putin without any evidence. We should also consider adding, Ms. Politkovskaya\u2019s murder, [EXTERNAL_LINK: Mr. Putin said, brought Russia \u201cfar greater injuries and damage than her publications.\u201d]\n*Opppose including this factoid unless actual evidence (as opposed to rank speculation) is produced which shows that there is a connection between the killing and the birthday.\n* Oppose  per Cullen328.  The sources  only speculate  that the kills may at the behest of Mr. Putin. Without some reliable source actually saying that they are, we cannot put that back in, per BLP. Strongly suggest we close this as opposed, because even with an overwhelming consensus of \"for\" we can't violate BLP\n::Simply mentioning this fact does not mean that the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin. In fact, Mr. Putin openly suggested himself (quotation above) that it was done by his enemies to discredit him. His statement was simply an additional indication of notability of this fact, discussed by nearly all sources. Hence this is not a BLP violation and required to be included per WP:NPOV. Yes, a number of RS (books that were also quoted above) claim explicitly that it was done by someone on his behalf. If that should be included is a different question.\n::We are NOT putting into the article that \"the murder was done on behest of Mr. Putin\" - that's a ridiculous framing of the issue (in fact most sources don't even speculate about that - the ignorance of this comment strongly suggests you haven't bothered looking at the sources provided!). Please stop trying to construct [WIKI_LINK: strawmen|strawmen arguments]. We are putting in info about the data on which the murder happened, which is mentioned in almost every source on the subject. Hence, according to [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP], this is NOT a BLP violation as it is extensively sourced to reliable (including scholarly and academic) sources. Please read [WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] again.\n*Oppose - Though supported in RS, it reads like a factoid and there is no correlation, just speculation.\n*Oppose Better suited for [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] if there is consensus that [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight is met there, and then only if [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] is followed. Nobody has offered an explanation at [WIKI_LINK: #Discussion] below why this bio should not summarize [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] per [WIKI_LINK: WP:SUMMARY]. I doubt the birthday would warrant mention in the assassination article's lead; therefore, it seems too detailed to be mention here in the general bio.\u2014\n====Discussion====\n[WIKI_LINK: WP:BLP] policy reminder: \"Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced \u2013 whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable \u2013 should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\" (emphasis mine)\n:@BMK. Yes, many sources above claim about the existence of \"an actual real-world connection between the events\" (as you asked). Are these claims \"verifiable\"? Yes, absolutely - [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Verifiability|in WP meaning]. This is reference work. We must only fairly summarize what RS tell on the subject - per WP:NPOV, WP:RS and WP:NOR.\nResponse to a comment above:\n\" 7 October is also the day that Desmond Tutu, Joy Behar, Oliver North etc etc were born.\" - yes but none of these other birthdays are mentioned in the sources. However the fact that it happened on Putin's birthday is mentioned in almost every source which discusses this topic\n\" some writer speculated that there was some connection it would not be appropriate for the article either\" - if ONE writer speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. If TWO writers speculated that there was some connection, it would not be appropriate to include. IF ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SOURCE on the topic includes the info, then yes, it is appropriate to include. Why is this so hard to understand? We follow sources. That's the only thing that gives us credibility as an online encyclopedia. You ignore what (all) sources say, you throw out that credibility.\n:Can't we just include some hedging language to the effect of \"some sources noted,\" or move it out of the lede?\n::Well it shouldn't be mentioned in the lede by any stretch, in my opinion (except possibly in the lede of [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]). I agree that \"Some sources noted that ...\" might be useful, although it should rightfully state that \"Many sources noted that\" because you'd be hard-pressed to find a reliable source that didn't note it, so in effect the entire preface is somewhat of a tautology.\n:::Alright. Whatever works.\nI'll let others assess if [WIKI_LINK: WP:DUE] weight exists to warrant it's mention.  However, if consensus is that it belongs, [WIKI_LINK: WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV] should then be applied. \"Many sources have noted ...\" needs to be supported by a reliable source stating the scope.  Otherwise, temper it with \"Some sources ...\", or just directly attribute it to a few notable sources by name without assessing how widespread the opinion is.\u2014\n:Agreed. I think that if this part will be inserted, this is the best and least-controversial way of doing so.\nAnother concern that I will leave to the experts is the weight of the assassination in relation to her bio.  Currently, it dominates the article in a larger proportion than it is discussed in the lead, which is inconsistent with [WIKI_LINK: WP:LEAD].  Also, given that [WIKI_LINK: Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya] exists, I would expect her assassination to be handled [WIKI_LINK: WP:SS|summary style].  Unless Putin's birthday belongs in the lead of the assassination article, I wouldn't expect such detail to be in the summary of her death in the main bio. However, the dedicated assassination article would have more leeway to include mention of the birthday.\u2014\n*Comment Without any context this is all meaningless. Just saying she was killed on Putin's birthday is trivial. With out evidence any connection or suggestion of Putin's involvement is a BLP violation but there are exceptions. The presence of a widely known (for lack of better term) Conspiracy theory would be acceptable. There are boundaries to this. Specifically the NPOV policy, which applied would be that we can not give weight to it actually being true. Think of the [WIKI_LINK: Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories]. While we can't present it as true as an encyclopedia we do record it as it is highly notable. The question would be if this is similar to the Obama birther conspiracy.\n::There's an important difference: we know the birther theory is untrue.  We certainly do not know that there is no truth to the \"Putin birthday connection\" theory.\n::It's neither trivial nor a conspiracy theory if every single one of the hundreds of [WIKI_LINK: WP:RS]s covering her assassination mentions the fact.\n:::It doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention she was killed on Putin's Birthday, it's still trivial. It would be just as trivial if you mentioned Fanni Kaplan  attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin on the day of her birth 50 years before. Only with context it is not trivial. In context you would mention the conspiracy theory. It's not relevant if we know that this conspiracy theory is untrue, it's only relevant that we do not know if it is true. We don't record the obama birther conspiracy because we know it's untrue, we record it because we know that it is notable. We record conspiracy theories related to the Chappaquiddick incident that we neither know as true or untrue. If this conspiracy theory is notable, that is if it would merit an article of it's own, then the birthday along with the conspiracy theory would have some place in the article. Context is everything. POV, Mentioning this birthday attempting to subtlety lead people to believe that putin had something to do with the death. NPOV, Mentioning the conspiracy theory, balanced, and outside of wikipedia voice to neither give it weight as either true or false.\n::::What do you mean \"it doesn't matter how many reliable sources mention\" it? What Wikipedia policy did you pull that out of? It's NOT trivial. How do we know it's not trivial? Because every freakin' source mentions it. YOU don't get to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not. Sources do.\n::::It's not that hard. Just follow Wikipedia policy rather than the fancies of your own imagination.\n:::::Nearly all sources not simply mention this fact, but explicitly claim an actual connection - based on analysis of other factual information related to the case. According to Putin, that was done by his enemies abroad to upset him. According to independent experts, that was done by his friends to please him. But according to nearly all sources, these events are actually connected.\n:::::It means that it doesn't matter how many reliable sources you have to say she was killed on Putin's birthday because this in itself is trivial. You can grasp at straws because you lack an actual argument and ignore the rest of what I have said. You want to put it in the article? Cool! That's fine. Make it non-trivial. How do you do this? Context. There is a context in which Putin's birthday becomes highly relevant. The unproven accusations, the multiple and highly notable unproven accusations. Now there's whole need to handle with care. If these independent experts for instance mentioned by My very best Wishes haven't proven that Putin's friend did it for him as a favor you can't present it as fact. You also present the other side of the coin, Putin's claim that his enemies did it. You also present the other conspiracy theories.\n::::::Again, exactly which Wikipedia policy is it that says that a user named Serialjoepsycho gets to decide what is \"trivial\" and what is not? Oh, that's right, none. None Wikipedia policy says that. Whether something is \"trivial\" or not is determined by whether it's mentioned in sources not by your own personal opinion.  You don't like that? Change the policy or find an internet project more amenable to your interest in conducting [WIKI_LINK: WP:OR|original research].\n:::::::Omg that's right. Wikipedia has hard and fast rules. What was I thinking? Oh wait no it actually doesn't. Some things actually left to common sense and editorial judgement. You aren't new so I wonder why you are ignoring this. Is this something that you don't like? There's other projects that you can of course join. Or perhaps you could stay on this project and give an actual reason that this isn't trivial. And context is not Original research. A two second google search uncovered this source . It talks about Putin's birthday. They also do something crazy and give some actual context to why her death on Putin's birthday is relevant. It's actually very likely that most if not all reliable sources give some kind of context as well. There's not tendency for reliable sources to say \"George was murdered today and the Sky was Blue.\" However the sources have said the Sky was blue and we arguing somehow this is important. It's suggested above that there is a source of Putin coming out on the very subject and addressing it. Context is an amazing thing. With out context you have an article about a woman who was an ardent critic of Putin that ends with BTW she was murdered on Putin's birthday. You are left with undue weight without the context and the context can be reliably sourced.\n::::::::Link/source you provided is a perfect example. This is an article in \"Independent\" that provides brief and fair summary of the events. Most other sources tell basically the same. This source did mention the fact and placed it in a certain context, just as most other sources. The only thing we should do is to fairly summarize the content of the sources, that is to mention the fact and to place it in the same context as sources do. There is nothing really to discuss here.\n[OUTDENT: 99] precisely.\n== ", "parent_id": "692890055.18414.18320", "replyTo_id": "682808016.27564.27564", "indentation": 1, "page_id": "6536604", "page_title": "Talk:Anna Politkovskaya", "type": "COMMENT_MODIFICATION", "id": "692916154.18414.18414", "rev_id": "692916154"}

As it was, it stood there as an innuendo in the lede that suggested to the reader that Putin ordered the killing or otherwise was quite involved in the killing, or that it was a tribute to Putin, or something of that nature, which has been stated by many editors here to be undesirable and not what we want in Wikipedia.

It was in the lede and so i removed it, as per the notes of the RfC closing which said that whatever the mixed results of the RfC, it was clear that there was opposition to it being in the lede. As it was, it stood there as an innuendo in the lede that suggested to the reader that Putin ordered the killing or otherwise was quite involved in the killing, or that it was a tribute to Putin, or something of that nature, which has been stated by many editors here to be undesirable and not what we want in Wikipedia.

A glance at the article's edit history shows a long-term edit war going on, plain to see. Please let that stop now.

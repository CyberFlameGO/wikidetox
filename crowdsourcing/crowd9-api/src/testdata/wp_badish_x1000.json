It's perfectly compliant with both NOTNEWS and NPOV. What do these two have to do with anything anyway? You're, once again, randomly quoting policies without rhyme or reason.:::::::::\"The source you cited above does not state anything indisputably\" - yes it does.

When people come and read this page they will continue to think Wiki is a complete joke.\"Claims that velvet antler supplements have beneficial effects for any human condition are not currently supported by sound clinical data from human trials.\"1st - Above the author claims that \"any\" human condition from a seven trials that did not study every human condition. Conjecture as the review did not cover every human condition and indeed really stupid looking since it says seven clinical trials prior to statement. Duh!2nd - The rest of the phrase is a broad generalization of all clinical data, when the review only covered data from seven clinical trail \"are not currently supported by sound clinical data from human trials.\" Any retard knows that seven clinical trials cannot supply such a statement.3rd - This is one of the statements that actually says nothing. For example: \"we proved nothing\". How can one prove nothing? Only the dumb and ignorant can't see this, yet it finds its way upon a supposed educational page.Since July I have offered logical and coherent statements that have been ignored or designated COI as if I have some other agenda than garbage of stupid stuff on wiki pages. One is the abstract from the conclusion the other is a paraphrase that better quotes the authors intentions and conclusions.So what is? Are Admin and Editors of Wiki brain-damaged individuals or are they capable of intelligent though?

I'm pretty sure any reasonable person understands that when, in the course of an everyday-English conversation, the term \"proof\" is used in reference to science, the intended meaning is \"well-tested and -accepted evidence\". A WP talk page is not a referred journal article, and we are not here to be the Language Police pestering each other about how we phrase things in informal chit-chat.As to the broader question, see Race (human categorization) and all the sources in it, and the larger pile of sources on its talk page for well-tested and -accepted evidence that \"race\" is primarily a social construct. No one said \"entirely\", so that's a straw man. The repeatably testable evidence to date for \"racial\" differences in average intelligence, temperament, various aptitudes, etc., shows differences so slight as to be statistically meaningless. The entire \"field\" is tainted with pseudoscience, though some of this was inadvertent. Early anthropologists were convinced that race was real and biological, and so designed studies and bent data to fit their preconceived notions.>With modern genetics, we know the idea is absurd. There's more genetic diversity between two neighboring African peoples than there is between the Japanese, the Irish, and the Australian Aboriginals. It's quite likely that more specific gene pools (sometimes thought of as narrower ethnicities, though that, too, is a misnomer) may have some slightly more marked neurological trait differences, but even this research is very spotty, e.g. showing multi-generationally strictly endogamous Ashkenazi Jews having around a 5 IQ-point lead above average, but only according to a few studies. Virtually no one has a taste for pursuing this kind of research. Given that in urban environments there virtually are no endogamous groups any longer, and haven't been for a long time, none of this is going to matter in a generation or two, and it barely matters at all now even as a statistical curiosity. If you hire someone just because they're of European Jewish ancestry and you think this means they'll be smarter than the other candidates, you're an idiot.>All the dirt-farmers in the world can keep marrying their neighbors and cousins, and it won't stop the overall hybridization of the human species. The only major population nut that's not being cracked much yet is China, but it's already wildly multi-ethnic anyway and has been for thousands of years. Westerners don't understand this, usually, because they don't know anything about China and its peoples. Along lines of Victorian racialist thinking, they see epicanthic folds and assume that everyone east of around Kazakhstan are all the same. Anyway, that which isn't socio-cultural is really all about haplogroups, not \"races\" or \"ethnicities\""}

In the gulag, the term has been conflated by many with very narrow social and religious prescriptions and co-opted by neoconservatism. During the 2008 election campaign, an article in Atlantic Monthly contrasted the old-fashioned conservatism of Edmund Burke with the right-wing radicalism of Newt Gingrich and company.[8]Note that left/right and liberal/conservative are only regarded as synonymous in the United States. Following a hung parliament in 2010 the Liberal Democrats entered into a coalition government with the Conservative Party. In Australia, the Liberal Party are the direct analogues of the US Republicans or the UK Conservatives \u2014 they're economically liberal and socially very conservative. Explaining this to American conservatives tends to make their heads explode.A lot of conservatives are mad at the damned liberals for disagreeing with them, and frequently attack them as general purpose scapegoats for any ills of society as seen from their perspective.\"Source: https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Political_spectrumCOMPARED WITH LEFT WING SECTION:\"A liberal tends to champion liberty, individual rights and equality, although it depends on what measures are being taken to realize those rights. Due to this, liberalism can fall under many branches, some even self-contradictory; for instance, classical liberalism favors limiting government action to promote individual rights while social or modern liberalism (a.k.a. progressivism) tends to favor government action to protect individuals. Unlike conservatism, its traditional political opposite, liberalism may be against the status quo, favoring changes to what liberals perceive as a better society.A lot of liberals believe conservatives are trying to curtail women's reproductive rights, impose religion on society, and preserve and promote corporate power and power for the historically privileged. Some liberals attack conservatives as general-purpose scapegoats for any ills of society as seen from their liberal perspective. (A lot of conservatives do make for an easy target. See Ann Coulter for just one of many examples.)\"Source: https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Political_spectrumDon't fucking lie to me and tell me that RationalWiki is not left wing."}

I just don't want to get into pointless editing wars, that's all: those can be VERY long and VERY annoying! As far as Valuev not being a good boxer: the guy is UNDEFEATED, 45-0; is on his way to beat Rocky Marciano's 49-0 record; hasn't yet been even nocked down, let alone nocked out; won the WBA Heavyweight Championship, defended it 4 times, winning all for by either a KO, or a TKO; is going to defend the championship a 5th time against Chagaev, hopefully will win, no I'm sure he'll win; and he even wrote a book of his own. What else does he have to do and accomplish to prove to you that he IS a good boxer?!

Furthermore, saying that Paris is among the cities hosting the most skyscrapers is a rather general statement, it's not as if any kind of ranking was given. :As for the removal of the word \\\"proper\\\" in the expression \\\"city proper\\\", actually, I've thought it could disturb the readers as they see below pictures of La D\\u00e9fense in the middle of a rather urban environment, and in saying it's to the west of the city, we could believe it's lost in the countryside. All this to say that I've found your edit more ambiguous than what was written earlier. :Finally, I haven't understood at all your edit about the 13th arrondissement. Chinatown is an informal expression, certainly not an official denomination. Furthermore, it didn't look very clear to me to say that the 13th arrondissement towers are located in its \\\"southern regions\\\".

Jay, My debate in this as been composed of three different phases: First I performed a simple transliteration from English to Japanese of both Marin and Malon and suggested that they were not the same, and that the record from Nintendo of America encourages this interpretation on their official site. I then proceded to find official documentation to verify the Japanese spelling.  Marin (\\u30de\\u30a3\\u30f3) I could find an official source for, but Malon I could not.  However, those who have explored the Zelda community enough (especially Japanese art sites) know pretty much from common knowledge that Malon is \\u30de\\u30ed\\u30f3, and as such I presumed that the record would enforce this end result. I then found an auxilliary source for Malon's name (\\u30de\\u30ed\\u30f3), and pointed out that difference. At no time in this argument have I \\\"jumped down [your] throat\\\" for not accepting this evidence.  On the contrary, I believe I've rather been fair and balanced on the whole issue.  I have to admit that, after I began presenting primary source documentation for the above facts, I did raise my eyebrow significantly at you to see that the name difference meant absolutely nothing to you despite it being perhaps your most significant claim. I have admitted from the beginning that I do believe that Malon and Talon were based off Marin and Tarin.  However, I cannot say with any certainty that this relationship is proven.  Simply put, there is no known documentation that explicitly states this.  I've never said that the article should not admit state this speculation; rather, I've said that the article in question should at most state something to the fact that most fans agree that Malon was based upon Malin since it is the majority opinion (I would wager) in the community; I've only explicitly argued that the two should not be equated as the same character.

Maybe it's just my short tenure here as a Wikipedian or perhaps it's just the controversy over on the Metroid articles, but I haven't been convinced that speculation is wholly discouraged on Wikipedia.  Taken from [WIKI_LINK: NPOV]: :::::*First, and most importantly, consider what it means to say that unbiased writing presents conflicting views without asserting them. Unbiased writing does not present only the most popular view; it does not assert the most popular view is correct after presenting all views; it does not assert that some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one. Presenting all points of view says, more or less, that p-ists believe that p, and q-ists believe that q, and that's where the debate stands at present. Ideally, presenting all points of view also gives a great deal of background on who believes that p and q and why, and which view is more popular (being careful not to associate popularity with correctness). Detailed articles might also contain the mutual evaluations of the p-ists and the q-ists, allowing each side to give its \\\"best shot\\\" at the other, but studiously refraining from saying who won the exchange. :::::To me, this encourages two differing sidesin this case, Jay and yourselfto write up something that really promotes their side, and then in a blazing display of NPOV, the two are smashed together into the same article to come up with an overall explanation of the situation.  It's because of this that I said I wouldn't mind seeing some in-between edit made to explain that this difference of opinion is there.  The only time an opinion should really be kept off of Wikipedia is if the position is so off-beat with public opinion that it becomes a Flat Earth Problem. :::::Unlike you, I'm more inclusionist than exclusionist (although there are limits to that), and I don't see the harm here in such an edit, although again, if you think I'm wrong in stating so, I'm willing to chalk this up to na\\u00efvet\\u00e9.\", \"timestamp\": \"2005-09-10 05:25:42 UTC\", \"status\": \"content changed\", \"toxicity_score\": 0.0588415017682028, \"parent_id\": \"22955430.20537.20537\", \"hashed_user_id\": \"f6b0fb4fc32f5f871be9a7e0b16b6a2ac38cf762\"}}</th>\n",

Writers such as Glasenapp, G.C. Pande and Padhmanabh Jaini  are of the view that the concept of Karma or moral causation was perhaps pre-Aryan in origin. However, other scholars such as Surendranath Das Gupta, Kshiti Mohan Sen, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Radhakrishan and Swami Abhedananda trace the origins of Karma to the Brahmanic world view itself as it developed over the centuries between the origin of the Samhitas and the development of the Upanishads. In that sense, the doctrine of Karma developed across Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism at around the same time. It is not clear therefore that a 'most scholars' interpret the concept of Karma as pre-aryan or non-Brahmanic in origin. Academic opinion is divided on the issue. If this article is to insist that 'most scholars' are of the view that the concept of Karma is pre-aryan, then it needs to be cited. I tend to be uncomfortable with the concept of 'Aryan' and 'pre-Aryan' when both Buddhist and Jain texts use the word 'Aryan' quite often to illustrate the origins and teachings of their founders i.e. the 'Aryan Eightfold path', the '4 Aryan truths' etc. In fact, the modern Indian word 'ji' comes from the Jain prakrit 'Aaji' which in turn means 'Arya'. The issue of Aryan vs pre-Aryan tends to instead fall within the Germanic school of Indian history but may not tally entirely with the facts. What is Aryan? What is pre-Aryan? Unless this is sorted out, care needs to be exercised in the flippant use of such terminology.\", \"timestamp\": \"2009-11-30 11:07:44 UTC\", \"status\": \"just added\", \"toxicity_score\": 0.10890888341269865, \"parent_id\": \"312205465.2614.2614\", \"hashed_user_id\": \"a2bd65ee73f295809d4dfd20899186ce36b5a50d\"}}, {\"312205402.2441.2441\": {\"id\": \"312205402.2441.2441\", \"comment_type\": \"COMMENT_MODIFICATION\", \"content\": \"=== ethical terms === \", \"timestamp\": \"2009-09-06 16:22:13 UTC\", \"status\": \"just added\", \"toxicity_score\": 0.17209841527057634, \"parent_id\": \"\", \"hashed_user_id\": \"8df31af8c5d118a27abad74a6a96fcd5a05851d6\"}, \"312208699.2528.2528\": {\"id\": \"312208699.2528.2528\", \"comment_type\": \"COMMENT_MODIFICATION\", \"content\": \" [WIKI_LINK: j\\u012bva] (soul) * [WIKI_LINK: sa\\u1e43s\\u0101ra] (material world) * [WIKI_LINK: mok\\u1e63a] (liberation) * le\\u015by\\u0101 * \\u0101srava * bandha (slavery) * \\u015arama\\u1e47a * S\\u0101\\u1e43khya * dravya karma * bhava karma * k\\u0101rma\\u1e47a \\u015bar\\u012bra * mahavrata * T\\u012brtha\\u1e47kara * Kevala J\\u00f1\\u0101na * R\\u0101ma * K\\u1e5b\\u1e63\\u1e47a * nirv\\u0101\\u1e47a * ahi\\u1e43s\\u0101 * deva * manu\\u1e63ya * n\\u0101raki * tirya\\u00f1ca * gati * nigoda * Y\\u0101j\\u00f1avalkya * Umasvati * [WIKI_LINK: Ganges@Ganga] * sallekhan\\u0101 * \\u015br\\u0101ddha * Bodhisattvas \", \"timestamp\": \"2009-09-06 16:45:03 UTC\", \"status\": \"just added\", \"toxicity_score\": 0.610723993777597, \"parent_id\": \"312205402.2441.2441\", \"hashed_user_id\": \"8df31af8c5d118a27abad74a6a96fcd5a05851d6\"}}, {\"49150286.160.160\": {\"id\": \"49150286.160.160\", \"comment_type\": \"COMMENT_MODIFICATION\", \"content\": \"Your user name or IP address has been blocked from editing.

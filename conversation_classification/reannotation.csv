I don't care now for that tag anymore, and I think my 'modern gnosticism' text is now finally semantically correct, but these 2 discussions are still ongoing so I might still need to say something there regarding either the text or Sheldrake.Ndru01"", ""timestamp"": ""2006-04-22 10:04:07 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""User talk:Ndru01"", ""user_text"": ""Ndru01"", ""parent_id"": ""49314140.11206.10874""}, ""49638207.11759.11759"": {""id"": ""49638207.11759.11759"", ""comment_type"": ""COMMENT_ADDING"", ""content"": "" :Trying to remove the pseudoscience category is an example of editing.

There is nothing in the text contradicting the idea of a \""British victory\"". And since this section deals both with the battle and its aftermath, we simply cannot ignore those sources which describe the consequences of the battle (i. e.: the destruction of the convoy, documented by an overwhelming number of authors). The reference to an Italian \""partial achievement\"" doesn't contradicts the fact of the British tactical victory; indeed, neither Mcintyre nor Stephen contradict themselves, since they are not dealing with the same subject. And if they are not dealing with the same subject (they are not putting in doubt the Royal Navy success), tell me please, where is the alleged \""undue weight\""? It is the same case of our discussion on \""tactical victory\"" and \""strategic victory\"" some months ago. Do you remember? You agreed then that a lonely source claiming an axis strategic success would be valid to support this idea, despite hundreds of authors asserting a British tactical victory. 3) You're miscounting the sources. The idea of partial achievement is supported not only by \""three sources\"" as claimed. The citations include not only Mcintyre, Stephen or Sadkovich, but Bauer and Young, Llewellyn, Simpson, and some Italian sources like Bernotti and Giorgerini. Then we have now 8 sources, already cited in footnotes. And, as exposed in point 2), this is an 8-0 ratio; the partial achievement of the Italian side doesn't contradicts the idea of a \""British victory\"", so this sources don't qualified as a \""minority view\"". 4) I strongly disagree with the proposed changes in the text of the section, since these seem to ignore the aftermath of the battle (the main subject of the title \""Assessments\"", I guess). The wording and the tone also seem unencyclopedic.

I just didn't want to add to the confusion by mentioning breweries at all in the main body of the article unless I was going to explain the whole thing. If we mention breweries in that sentence, can we move the big explanatory footnote up to that sentence? (Really? I thought the catalogue was funny, but maybe I only think that it is funny because I do things like that and people always laugh at me. I know nothing about breweries, so perhaps I don't find them suitably amusing.)  | ****Brewing plays a surprisingly large role in the history of science, from the Enlightenment all the way to the mid-20th century.  Thermodynamics, pneumatics and gas chemistry, the debate over spontaneious generation, the birth of biochemistry, industrial biotechnology (of the pre-genetic engineering sort), drug manufacturing... brewing comes up over and over.  The footnote seems like it's addressing a pretty minor myth, but I suppose it could be moved up into the text; the use of the brewery seems to me much more significant than whether it was the sole reason for certain experiments.  I suspect that the number of readers who have heard that myth in the first place will be very, very small; it hardly seems worth mentioning even in a footnote, in my view.  Schofield takes issue with it, because it's something that he can point out and say \""Priestley is wrong here about his own history\"" (as biographers are wont to do), but for our purposes it seems like an issue that can be left out altogether, both Priestley's claim and Schofield's rejoinder. **PS: Please take all my edits as mere suggestions; you're the mastermind behind this article, and if you summarily revert any of my changes, my feelings won't be hurt.

Biology deals with cells, which form tissues; tissues form organs; organs form organisms. The underpinning of all of this is chemistry (i.e. molecules) - this is why there is a specific discipline known as [molecular biology]. Describing mental illness on the cellular, tissue or organ levels is all well and good, but ultimately we seek to understand the underlying chemistry. As I have repeatedly pointed out, the human organism is nothing more than a massive cluster of molecules acting in concert. At the most elementary level, we are composed of many trillions of elements (no linguistic irony intended) that are chemically bound together. This in turn forms the molecules that make up everything on this planet, including humans. There is no room in this article for discussion of opinions of any type on this matter. It was once thought the the brain was a \""black box\"", which could only be described in terms of its input and output (much like a computer, although we obviously can describe the processes that go on in between in this case). This is now known to be false, for the reason I pointed out above - at the most basic level, every animal is comprised of molecules. This fact is not open for debate. This may sound \""cold\"", \""mechanistic\"" or even \""inhuman\"" to some people, but it is undeniably and categorically true. If it were not true, then we could never know anything about biology, chemistry, or any of the natural sciences.

I personally think we should make clear what his position was in the film industry, and we should give some indication of the reaction to his death. Just as we report on his childhood and the roles he played throughout his career, these are important elements of his story that [I think] belong in his article.

Part of the reason for that is not knowing who writes the articles.  Granted the policies are meant to keep from people from such obvious fabrications as \""Black is White and Up is Down\"" but as any wordsmith knows, the right word here or there can slant an article.  Or the selective use of sources that spin a particular bias.  The entries on Islam in Indonesia had this kind of problem.  Knowing who wrote allows me to assess the bias that might be present.  I know that the commmunity editing process is supposed to correct these sort of problems but the horrid pesantren article has been up for over a year.

Leonardo painted nekkid pictures of boys!  HE MUST HAVE WANTED TO HAVE HAD SEX WITH THEM.\"")  This is original research in the extreme, in addition to being simply ignorant of the themes that permeated Renaissance art and showing a willingness to impose 21st century know-nothing sexual attitudes on a 15th century man.  Second, where citations are made, they prefer less-scholarly, \""single-issue\"" sources to more accepted da Vinci biographers (glbtq.com and Crompton.  Crompton, at least, is a well-known scholar, but his work needs to be used in the context of the dog not barking:  that is, of other major biographers without a political agenda not making such sweeping claims about da Vinci's sexuality.)  In short, these additions egregiously violate several of Wikipedia's core philosophies:  they are written to persuade and argue a point of view, that point of view is not supported by mainstream sources, and in places that point of view is presented as an entirely novel argument developed by Wikipedia editors.

I absolutely believe this article should exist, and support its further development. As I mentioned above, most of the changes I made were grammar fixes. This is not a criticism of Atropos, but just me trying to fix what I see as opportunities to improve the article. I used the term [cruft], which maybe is a little unfair, but I do think there are some issues with the article. Others may have different opinions, which is not only okay, it's GREAT. Indeed, some of the content that I thought was unnecessary, others thought was important and added back in with just a few clicks. That's the beauty of Wikipedia: no one person has control over an article. One thing that I think could use improvement is the lack of cited sources. I have no doubt that most of the information on the article is accurate, but nothing is stopping someone from adding in that, say, \""Kerry was born in Latvia and received the Purple Heart in the Vietnam War.\"" If there are no sources cited, its hard to distinguish true information from misleading statements. That's kind of a tricky move for an article about a radio show, but where possible, we should add in citations. Atropos has been keeping a blog of the show, so that is actually simplified a LOT. Lets throw in some citations to the blog (for those new to Wikipeida, see [Wikipedia:Citing sources] to see how), and other media references to the show, such as the recent Salt Lake Tribune article. I wholeheartedly second Bill's call to arms for fans of the show to come here and participate in the discussion and article.

According to her letters, she tried it once and didn't enjoy it. ::As far as Garbo's lovers, the list on her page is not correct - for instance, she only met Marlene Dietrich once and she was never involved with Claudette Colbert. Peter Viertel says that without question, his mother was never sexually involved with Greta Garbo.

You really don't seem to be capable of ever being less than confrontational and intransigent.  Wikipedia is not a free for all, it is not acceptable to make a few comments on a talk page and then assume that you have carte blanch to make whatever changes you like and to edit war.

You appear to be more interested with arguing on talk pages and promoting your own personal ideas than constructively writing articles. If someone provides evidence that an expert has produced a theory that contradicts you, instead of accepting that this point of view is valid and relevant, you try to either claim it supports you (when it clearly does not), or that we should not include this theory, or you attack the user who introduces the evidence calling then ignorant, or stupid or biased (you called me all three on talk English people in a single post). You don't seem to be interested in going and reading and understanding the theory, you don't seem to be capable of accepting that two competing theories can both exist and both be valid and both be worthy of inclusion. You prefer to think that only your preferred theory has any merit, and you ceaselessly promote it and edit war. I don't understand you at all, this is not how we should behave. When there is no support for you then you need to understand that and give it up. I really don't understand why you constantly claim that you speak for \""most people\"" or that you have the support of a consensus.

Hence, moving the article to a specific title which captures this aspect could be a good idea, either as \""Rape in the Bosnian Genocide\"" or perhaps preferably \""Systematic rape in the Bosnian War\"". The issue, though, with limiting the article title to this main aspect are those minority cases of sporadic rape which affected women of all ethnic groups; i.e. not only Bosniak women. The \""general\"" title \""Rape in the Bosnian War\"" is thus slighlty more inclusive in this sense, and underscores that on a lesser scale women of all ethnic groups were affected by [sporadic] rape. Simply put, there are arguments in favour of both titles, however my opinion is that the systematic use of rape was such a dominant and notable feature in the Bosnian conflict that this should be understood from the title (while for that matter also explaining in the article that sporadic rapes occured on all sides). The title \""Bosnian Genocide\"" is a bit more complicated though, since the notion of the extent of the  [Bosnian Genocide] is not entirely uniform. So far, the international courts have only ruled the [Srebrenica massacre] to be a genocide in the Bosnian War, whereas several academics and authorities, including the US congress, have deemed that ethnic cleansing as carried out by the Bosnian Serb army was genocide in a \""wider\"" sense. Currently, however, genocide in wider Bosnia is being tried in the ongoing trials of Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, so the final word has not yet been heard from the international tribunal. For these reasons, I would (still) tend to prefer the title \""Systematic rape in the Bosnian War\"" if a move is to be made.  \u03e1"", ""timestamp"": ""2014-06-24 17:00:08 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""Talk:Rape during the Bosnian War"", ""user_text"": ""Praxis Icosahedron"", ""parent_id"": ""614231527.10190.10190""}, ""614264537.10967.10967"": {""id"": ""614264537.10967.10967"", ""comment_type"": ""COMMENT_ADDING"", ""content"": "" ::Hmm, there were a genocide,the rapes were a part of it, this is quite simply what will be written/"", ""timestamp"": ""2014-06-24 19:14:43 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""Talk:Rape during the Bosnian War"", ""user_text"": ""Darkness Shines"", ""parent_id"": ""614231527.10190.10190""}}"

In addition of course there are so many variables involved anyway - eg whether you are looking at the ministerial title when preceding the office-holder's name, as compared to general references to the post itself; whether the formal name of the ministerial post is being used, or a shorthand alternative, or a more generic description; specific cabinets, as above, rather than general references to the cabinet. My personal preference is for less capitalisation. I suspect though that people really don't care too much either way, ie whether it's a jumbled mess, or whether most titles, posts and collective nouns are changed to go up or most changed to go down.

I will do my best to provide this, but you need to understand that for Wikipedia to be a functioning website its rules have to be somewhat subjective; it's simply impossible to write rules for every situation.  Where there aren't rules, we use common sense and take the purpose of the encyclopedia as a whole and of the particular page into account.  Things that tend to hurt those purposes will generally be regarded as bad, while those that help will be regarded as good. There will often not be clear lines between the two. Humor at the reference desk is good, because it fosters a sense of community and keeps people entertained as they ask and answer questions.  However, comments that it is reasonable to believe might put off or insult the new user are bad: we need as many users as we can get, and [WP:BITE@we want to be as encouraging to them as we can].  Also, comments that don't contribute to answering questions can (in excess) be bad because they make it harder for everyone to figure out if the question has been answered or not. I'd also like to caution you again about \""testing the waters\"" to try to figure out whether a given comment/question will be allowed or not.  This has the potential to be [WP:POINT@disrupting Wikipedia to make a point].  Also, arguing that people don't have the right to censor you will not be an effective approach; users here do have the ability to edit pages to insure they serve their purpose, and avoiding newbie-biting is a reasonably good reason to do so. I know this is not as specific as the guidance that you're hoping for.  I hope I've explained why it's hard to be much more specific.

The organization here is very poor.  New user menus are currently buried at the bottom.  This is ridiculous.  We need to imply in the design that there are new users, experienced users, and power users.  So there should be a three menu interface allowing the initial click to change the entire menu to the suggested user experience menu on top.  In other words, the destination board has one of the three color coded menus.  For example, a user clicks ANI.  At the board you get the power user interface.  But wait, a user clicks on editor assistance.  Then it changes to more of a new user menu.  So the first click on any menu will bring you to one of three interfaces.  So I'm proposing three different menus to cover all of the linked articles sorted by user expertise instead of one single template menu.  That's why the sort is so off. A new user clicking on the arbitration board should get a menu of power user links, not a link to editor assistance.  Of course, it's possible that those links are still accessible but grayed out, highlighting the current menu.

The nazi marches is one thing that has to do only with Russians vs. Latvians not human rights (is holding a meeting violation of human rights ?). I left everything else, but the claims are exaggerated: * It needs to be noted that the move of not granting Russian-speaking population voting rights was clearly political. - no it doesn't, politics are political, this is redundant. * It resulted in significant minority of population in Latvia being unrepresented in parliament. around 50% of Russians have citizenship and voting rights, there are pro-minorities parties in parliament. * Further policies introduced by the Latvian Government were aimed at decreasing the influence of the Russian language in the country. For example, a ban was introduced on street signs in Russian. Laws were passed prohibiting anyone from speaking Russian while at work. I am not sure if first example can be described as ban, the second is simply not true. Needs to be reworde to reflect the facts (that there are no bilingual signs anymore and that there are sme requirements to know Latvian for certain jobs) * Furthermore, a highly controversial education reform was launched, abolishing all Russian schools and introducing compulsory education in Latvian. Also not true - while the reform was controversial, Russian schools were not abolished, rather students are required to take part of the classes in Latvian * Such policies left a significant minority without access to education in their native language and could be seen as a violation of the European Convention of Human Rights, which Latvia is a party to.'' As said above education in native language is at least partly available. And who sees this as violation ? And if it is about human rights, other human right questions should be addressed - what about right of gathering and protesting ?

Latvia, \u0100damsons v. Latvia, Podkolzina v. Latvia, see; European Court of Human Rights. In every case the Latvian government was found to be discriminatory, and was ordered to pay substantial payments to the affected parties. The Language policy of Latvia was called discriminatory by the US government, and was articulated by former ambassador to the Baltic States, Catherine Todd Bailey. It was made illegal to speak any language but Latvian at government buildings or departments in Latvia. Public signage cannot be in Russian at an locale, even if it is majority Russophone, such as Riga, and Daugavpils. Conditions of prisons in Latvia have been highly criticized as being decrepit and dangerous by the EU, and the foreign ministry of the British government, among others. It's policies towards the treatment of LGBT rights have been scrutinized as discriminatory, see; Janis Smits. The annual gathering of the pro-SS in Riga, who collaborated with the Nazi's in the mass murder of over 85,000 Jews, and the killing of the allied forces has caused considerable anger in EU nations, such as Britain, and the Netherlands. The Latvian government spends annually 0,6 million euros on security and organizational overhead costs to protect the ceremony so that it can be completed every year. The treatment of Gypsies has been flagged by the LCHRES. From BBC: \""ensuring human rights of patients in mental health clinics, residents of immigration camps and police victims. Experts noted particular cruelty of Latvian policemen on the borderline with tortures. The system of monitoring the measures taken following violations complaints against Latvian police is not developed. The problem of overpopulation in Latvian prisons has not been resolved.

I haven't read your new edits yet, but I noticed that you inserted a lot of {{fact}} tags. That is fine, but I don't think you need to have square brackets around the text you think need to be cited. It makes the article appear even more of a draft that it does already. Also, you may want to use the sandbox when editing (or copy the text into another editor). This will enable you to come off with fewer, but larger edits (remember edit summaries) thereby making it easier for other editors to assess what you have been doing (compared with now where you make numerous small edits within short time). Happy editing ', ' :Hi der mr Jensen, i feel the brackets are extremely neccesary as they are really there to point out glaring, unproveable assertions, referenced or not, to fundamental errors within an almost(I'm willing to put up with a certain amount of \""rock music journalese\"") acceptable text. After all it's always possible to come up with commercially warped, hyperbolic versions of the original quotations from CD notes, aimed at what the authors of said distortions obviously percieve as a shallow, easily manipulated market (\""Never give a sucker an even break\"" author Barnum blah blah etc.) Most of the stuff in brackets is nonsense , I mean check out the bit on Hendrix going to see King Creole in Paris, it's basically gibberish! I have no desire to puff up this article and have subsequently only made small changes to the text, as my earlier larger ones were only my way of explaining the faults and giving the information to correct these to whoever might be the editors/contributors (hence the \""or\"" comments and not knowing how to reply to editors comments made to me on wiki - I thought there was some hidden e-mail type thing!). The important credit \""bandleader\"" is unsourceable directly, although understood implicitly since he arrived in England in late 66, no serious commentator on Hendrix could logically dispute this. He chose the musicians, he sacked them. Period. :: I share you concerns, but those are not an argument for making up own styles like inerting brackets. The fact tag is sufficient.

Using the 'reliable sources/verifiability' standard is quite simply how Wikipedia works\"" is a remarkable breath of fresh air in the CfD process. I have been involved in AfD for years and got sucked into the CfD process when a category I use was proposed for deletion not too long ago. CfD operates under the influence of an extremely small group of editors who have an approach to categories that differs from yours and mine, and from how most of the rest of Wikipedia works. As you have done in this current CfD, I have advocated in multiple CfDs that clear and objective inclusion standards be defined and adhered to, just as you have suggested. The responses are to insist that whatever standard you come up with, no matter how grounded in sources, is \""arbitrary\"", after all there's some other standard that could have been chosen. The other response to any proposed standard, no matter how well-defined, is to identify an actual (or, just as often, hypothetical) borderline case and to insist that this shows an underlying flaw with the category that requires the deletion of the entire structure. In other situations there's the \""listify\"", which pushes for deletion of a category because it would be a \""better\"" list, despite [WP:CLN] encouraging co-existence of both lists AND categories. Another favorite approach is to insist that a category is \""trivial\"" or \""non-defining\"", often with an appeal to a claim of [WP:OCAT@overcategorization]; sources that contradict the claim are conveniently ignored. Any sane person would leave this particular asylum, where sources and logic have little sway, but any input you could offer would at least confirm that I'm not the only one who believes that \""the 'reliable sources/verifiability' standard is quite simply how Wikipedia works.\"" Thank you again for your insight."", ""timestamp"": ""2008-10-08 15:07:20 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""User talk:Thibbs"", ""user_text"": ""Alansohn"", ""parent_id"": ""243903070.10455.10455""}, ""243919275.11186.11186"": {""id"": ""243919275.11186.11186"", ""comment_type"": ""COMMENT_ADDING"", ""content"": "" :Thank you.

This explains why most puzzle games are considered non-violent despite the fact that the main character may be injured or killed (even violently so) by hazards (including sentient enemies). I understand very well that you don't think any game that contains any violence is non-violent, but your argument suffers from an obvious lack of sources as backup and an overly strict definition of violence. The fact is that reviewers, marketers, and non-violent game communities have characterized some games that do contain objective violence as non-violent. The apparently conflicted definition is only conflictory to those who are of the opinion that any violence makes a game a violent game.

Yes, lowering myself to the level of others was wrong, and I admit that mistake. Yet there's a serious injustice going on here at Wikipedia. Certain users are pretty much getting away with murder when it comes to incivility, yet the admins seem to be oblivious about it all. I actually got blocked today for calling someone a coward, which, admittedly, was wrong. Yet take a look at the shockingly disgusting exchange of insults on the RefDesk talk page in the discussion entitled \""Not a soapbox\"". Why are certain users allowed to attack others as being \""intellectually impoverished wankers\"", among dozens of other equally disgusting insults, without even getting so much as a warning, while, at the same time, my referring to someone as a \""coward\"" (which, though admittedly insulting, is not the least bit vulgar) gets me blocked? I hope you can understand how frustrating it can be to be forced to play on such an uneven playing field. Yes it was a mistake to call hipocrite a coward, I just lost my cool. I just only wish that everyone were subject to the same rules. I honestly believe that if that were the case, much of this nonsensical hostility would disappear. The admins just don't seem to realize, but in ignoring Clio's insulting remarks, and given her young age, they're creating a monster. They're basically telling her that she can insult others to her heart's content and not get the slightest warning about it, because, as we all know, she's always right, and everyone else is always wrong. These are the worst possible of messages to be sending a obnoxious, arrogant 24 year old girl. She's obviously intelligent, and one would hope, for her sake at least, that her intelligence be tempered with discipline and humility. If only an admin would send her a warning: \""Look, Clio, you've got to tone it down, your insults of others are just as innapropriate as those directed at you. If you're criticized, that doesn't invariably mean that the world is out to get you in some sort \""witch-hunt\"". You've got to learn to show some respect for others if you expect them to show respect for you\"". That's all. Like I said, she's a very intelligent girl with a great deal of potential. And I wish her the best in achieving that potential. Yet she's desperately lacking in social skills. If someone doesn't finally put their foot down, put her in her place, and tell her when she's acting inappropriately, she'll never achieve that potential, and that would be a shame. But there's only so much I can do. After all, I've done quite well for myself and live a happy and successful life. It's her life and happiness that are at stake here. I can try here and there, but without any support, and on top of that getting blocked for a silly mistake really doesn't help. Anyway, I've gone on too long. I'd be really interested in your feedback, though. Write back if you can.

To put it bluntly, I think you should drop it v/v Clio; as a wise person once told me, \""There's no cheese down that hole.\"" I'm not commenting on who's right, who's wrong, who started it, etc, but I implore you to be the one to finish it. Just drop it, file it under Written Off Debts, and continue editing constructively. :If Clio irritates you that much (and I have had similar experiences with editors), unless you are willing to pursue it formally, just, for your own sanity, gloss over her contributions, discipline yourself to ignore her talk page entries, and ignore her. I've done that with some editors and it saved my Wikilife. There are many editors whose intellect and experience are appropriate for WP but whose personalities are not. IMO I am not an appropriate judge of that distinction, and neither are you. If an editor can't hack the community, they will crash and burn in due time without your help. Don't be that person. (The one who crashes and burns). You are well on your way, IMO, to becoming the person other editors shake their heads about (as I did with two editors recently) and say to themselves, 'That editor is either going to flounce in a huff or be permablocked.' Stay frosty.':To put it another way, I think one of the first rules of functioning happily on WP is to accept that WP is grossly unfair, manifestly so. I'm not commenting on the unfairness or perceived unfairness of your particular situation, I want to be very clear on that. I'm just saying in general. And the abiliy of an editor to accept that fact is IMO the greatest indicator of whether or not they'll be able to function on WP and contribute constructively. :I wish you well in your RL and WL, and I hope we intersect in happier circumstances. IMO that depends on you. You cannot ever control another's behaviour, only your own. Ruminating over this issue can do nothing but strangle your WP contributions and poison your RL. Don't let it do that. :And finally, I feel that some of your comments regarding Clio are inappropriate; \""obnoxious, arrogant\"", \""desperately lacking in social skills\""''. Whether they are accurate or not, they are unwelcome on my talkpage. Would you consider striking them? To comment on the general thrust, it's not WP's place to assist in social development; if you feel something is lacking, you will have to trust in life in general to deliver that message. But my personal advice to you is just to stop speculating, ruminating, drawing conclusions, etc, and move on.

If he really did become two things (Triple Crown and Grand Slam through that one title win) both sites would mention both accomplishments then it would be safe to say that the United States title is a third tier title. Both sites show that he only became one thing, and the one thing we know for a fact that he'd become with his past titles plus an IC title is a Triple Crown which is what the WWE's official website, TV shows, and Miz himself have confirmed. How did you seriously think that one line in a non-official WWE article about one random superstar that happens to randomly state he's a grandslam champion make it 100% true that the United States title is third tier? On that same ION Television website it says nothing about GrandSlam status for Dolph Ziggler, I guess you didn't read his article. With your logic, he should be grand slam champion there too, but he's not mentioned as one there. Also the only other person that is actually grand slam champion on that site (without considering the US title), Big Show, has no mention of grand slam status either. So why did they mention it for Miz? Simple, back then he was bragging about becoming Triple Crown champion. That was his thing back then, and ION clearly was mistaken on the name of it. They got Grand Slam confused with Triple Crown. Seriously there needs to be way more evidence to support the US title being a third tier title than that one line in an article that isn't on WWE.COM. Since when did Wikipedia jump the gun and just change things so drastically off of one article that clearly was a mistake.

His purpose in doing this, according to the [International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia] (ICTY) prosecutors, was to support a \""joint criminal enterprise\"" to create a new Serb-dominated state from which the non-Serb population had been forcibly removed. with Nelodkan preferring the following wording: :The financial and logistical assistance that Milo\u0161evi\u0107's government provided to the Croatian Serbs and the supposed influence that Milosevic had over Croatian Serbs was later a basis for indicment by the [International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia] (ICTY) against Milosevic for his supposed membership in the \""joint criminal enterprise\"" to alledgedly create a new Serb-dominated state from which the non-Serb population had been forcibly removed. I think if a view is expressed in the article, we ought to attribute the view properly.

Similarly, it's a matter of fact that the ICTY took the view that I've summarised in the lines above (the wording is taken nearly directly from its indictment of Milosevic).

Why should be hidden that western and northern Croatia was part of Croatia at that time? :No; the whole geographical Bosnia was included in his state. ::Early medieval Bosnia included only teritories between Vrbas and Drina south of todays town of Maglaj (so excluding kingdoms of Soli and Usora). Una was in the middle of Croatian state, not it's border. So it is not whole of today's Bosnia, but rather just eastern and central part. 3)At the begining of the war Serb made 31.4% of Bosnian population (see bosnian census) :A number declared as Yugoslavs. - ::And you know which ones of them did it? Bravo! Can you tell me am I going to win the lotery also?:) 4)Croatian war operations in western Bosnia came with authority of President Tudjman, and Croatian command.

At first they were on self-initiative of Ante Gotovina; President Tudjman later authorized it to save Gotovina's but.

It's \""namyuekok\"", then a dot, then \""freeforums\"" then dot-org (hope it still won't block \""namyuekok\""). I didn't really take this seriously at first. I mean, I took Manchukuo seriously, because it made more sense. The Manchu had been at war with China less than a century ago, and they had had their own state before they were joined to China by conquering it, making their predicament somewhat similar to that of the Tatars in Russia. Given they lacked a majority over their homeland, an independence movement would be fringe, but it would most likely exist, as the website confirmed. There are always those who resent the rule, especially if they descend from branches of the former ruling family as some people on the Manchukuo site claim to. However, the Cantonese speakers I know all identify as Han Chinese. If anything it is the Mandarin speakers who identify differences between the two, and this is generally the historical pattern as well. Guangdong is subject to much migration and whatnot, and so what would be a Cantonese ethnicity if it existed is now spread all over the country. So of course I didn't take it seriously. While the site does not seem to get much activity, browsing around, I found that there is a notable indication of organization of some group. There is footage of some sot of uprising, as well as holding of offline meetings, events, etc. The site is probably supposed to be a forum made for some group that was offline before online. So, of course, if it is actually legit, it is a ultraradical fringe group that gets about 0% support, and is probably completely insignificant, but even so, can't it still be called a separatist group.

The irony of it was that the man who made the anti Rick Ross site also made the anti Potter's House link that was permitted and was of lesser notoriety and quality. So in other words, Rick Ross supporters hate the links I want to put up, and fight against them, but the links Darren put up are of lesser quality and permitted because they don't affect Ross. That is why I previously mediated. I wouldn't mind having ALL links allowed, because I have links that show strong counter arguments, but Ross' friends won't allow them.

In this case, I found this when looking into the [WP:ITN/C#Carbon] proposal to have a front page blurb about the 6 co-ordinate carbon structure reported in the dication of hexamethylbenzene.  I edit Wikipedia because I enjoy it and learn from it, and when I have started something I'll put effort into building it, but I don't always edit to build a systematic encyclopaedic article on a topic from the ground out.  I recognise that small additions here and there can lead to an overall UNDUE issue, which is why I appreciate others coming along and tweaking or even removing content.  I do appreciate you stopping by, happy to discuss editing.  I hope you can see and accept that my addition to zinc chloride is not what I might have done had I come to the article with the aim of expanding / developing content on zinc chloride, but I didn't come to write about zinc chloride in general but instead to add something interesting fitting within the existing content.  Had it been zinc chloride catalysing a thoroughly unexceptional reaction, like (say) the Friedel-Crafts ethylation of an activated benzene with EtCl / ZnCl2, then I would not have added it.  However, what I added offers an example of alkylation (which was not there) and an unusual building of a carbon skeleton.  I know that we don't want the interesting to crowd out the important, but that doesn't mean not including some of the interesting.  I don't think I have obscured the important, but you may disagree.  Anyway, having written too much, if you want to make changes, go for it.  I'm happy to say thanks when a change to what I have added results in an improvement to the encyclopaedia, and certainly an external perspective can see flaws more readily.

All that I did was make the page more succinct.  let's look at a paragraph to see this: MINE: Soap removes the seasoning from cast-iron cookware. However, a very well-seasoned pan can tolerate dilute dish soap, and, for infrequently used pans, this may be preferable to leaving rancid grease on the cooking surface. In general, however, regular washing with soap is not recommended. EXISTING: It is common knowledge that one should never use soap to clean seasoned cast iron cookware; this will immediately remove the oil, and 'unseason' the pan (or even, according to some cooks, leave soap residue that will poison the food). In fact, a very well-seasoned pan can tolerate dilute dish soap, and, for infrequently used pans, this may be preferable to leaving rancid grease on the cooking surface. In general, however, regular washing with soap is not recommended. When [cast iron] cookware is washed with soap it should be lightly oiled before it is used or stored away. We should never write \""It is common knowledge\"", unless you have a survey of people that shows that something is common knowledge.  If it's common knowledge, just say it.  Instead of writing \""never use soap to...\"", just write what the soap does.  Soap cannot poison food no matter what chefs say you would need to find a reference to prove that.

Karabakh and Zangezur remained under Azerbaijani jurisdiction, pending final resolution at the Paris Peace Conference. The Armenian militants broke the truce, when they started a surprise attack at the Azerbaijani garrisons in Khankendi and Askeran and the Azeri quarter of Shusha, when Azeris were celebrating Novruz. These attacks failed, and the Armenian part of Shusha was destroyed as result of fighting. Even the Armenian sources acknowledge that it was the Armenian side who started the hostilities and broke the truce: Failure at Khankend sealed the doom of Shushi. As planned, the Varanda militia entered Shushi on the evening of March 22, supposedly to receive its pay and to felicitate Governor-General Sultanov on the occasion of Novruz Bairam. That same night, about 100 armed men led by Nerses Azbekian slipped into the city to disarm the Azerbaijani garrison in the Armenian quarter. But everything went wrong. The Varanda militiamen spent most of the night eating and drinking and were late in taking up their assigned positions, whereas Azbekian's detachment, failing to link up with the militia, began firing on the Azerbaijani fort from afar, awakening the troops and sending them scurrying to arms. It was only then that the Varanda militiamen were roused and began seizing Azerbaijani officers quartered in Armenian homes. The confusion on both sides continued until dawn, when the Azerbaijanis learned that their garrison at Khankend had held and, heartened, began to spread out into the Armenian quarter. The fighting took the Armenians of Shushi by surprise. Several thousand fled under cover of the dense fog by way of Karintak into the Varanda countryside. Richard G. Hovannisian.

As for part of your original complaint, \""the same page is advertising Chanel 7, the bingo show, and links to and advertises many other commercial programs (Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader)\"". Let's consider here - a page about a TV mentioning the show itself? That has to be advertising, right? And mentioning the channel itself? Imagine if you saw an ad on the net saying \""Watch the coolest show ever, Monday at 9\"" - would you know what channel it belonged to? Finally, the link to Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader is just a link at the end of the page, because it is related to his show (being in the same genre). I'm sure if there was a decent page for this program that was more than just QQ'ing, it would more than deserve its place in the see also section. Until then, I think it doesn't deserve to be on this page.

Your ascerbic talk-page comments were not always helpful, but they were often quite amusing. Initially I was very wary of you. Our first encounters were usually negative, as a result of you disagreeing with something I had done (mostly involving routemaps, IIRC), but by the time of the block I had recognised you as a friend here. I think the turning point was when you dropped a message on my talk page in response to another's query about a Thomas page up for AfD, before I had had a chance to answer. It was a complete surprise to see that you were watching the page, but as I was in complete agreement with you it was not a problem! :I hope that makes some kind of sense. It's a bit difficult to explain, and your final comments on that other page did make me wonder whether I'd been doing the right thing.

However, I will express some doubt that it actually does BOTH of these things: (1) Generate energy than it consumes and (2) does so by fusing hydrogen with nickel to make copper.  That's because of something called \""the curve of binding energy\"" of atomic nuclei.  It is thoroughly documented that for all atomic nuclei more massive than Iron-56 (which includes all naturally stable atoms of nickel), the amount of energy it takes to cause such a nucleus to fuse with another is always more than the amount of energy released by the fusion reaction.  Such heavier-than-iron nuclei are Naturally made in supernova explosions, where lots of energy is available to force them to be made.  Thus we can use a small amount of energy to split a uranium nucleus, and obtain a lot of energy.  THINK of a fission event happening \""backward\"":  You have to start with potential fission products and force them together to make a uranium nucleus, an action that will require adding the same large amount of energy that could be released by fission.  Thus backing-up what I wrote about only getting a small amount of energy out of fusing those nuclei to make uranium on a much lesser scale, the same is true of fusing nickel with hydrogen to make copper to cause \""copper fission\"", if the nucleus was hit by an energetic particle and as a result it broke apart into nickel and hydrogen, the released energy would be greater than the amount needed to do the breaking.  So, if Rossi's device works to generate more energy than it consumes, it must be doing something more than ONLY (if it does this at all) fusing hydrogen with nickel.  I'd say it more likely is fusing hydrogen with hydrogen.

At least some of them should be carried out before it's allowed to go back to doing its business, because this attack vector was just discovered, and I'm sure is only going to be used a lot more until it's fixed. Don't allow archiving across subpages.  For example, User talk:Cyde is allowed to be archived anywhere in a subpage of User talk:Cyde/, but nowhere else, and certainly not a different user's subpage. Don't allow archiving for anonymous users.  I can't really think of a legitimate use for this. Allow Werdnabot's processing list to be locked down.  Don't work off a list on a what links here from a template; this cannot be locked down because the template can be added by anyone to any one of millions of various talk pages that anonymous users can edit.  Rather, have a centralized, protected page listing all of the talk pages that are authorized to be edited.  Admins can add to this list and there will be a queue where normal users can request to have their talk pages archived.  The target of the archiving is still specified in the same tag on the user's talk page (this way every time they want to change the target they don't have to bug an admin).

Here's what the referenced source says: \""In 1982, a phase II study with 175 patients looked at which types of cancer might benefit from treatment with amygdalin. Most of the patients in this study had breast, colon, or lung cancer. Amygdalin was given by injection for 21 days, followed by oral maintenance therapy using doses and procedures similar to those in the phase I study. Vitamins and pancreatic enzymes were also given as part of a metabolic therapy program that also included dietary changes. One stomach cancer patient showed a decrease in tumor size, which was maintained for 10 weeks while the patient was on amygdalin therapy. In about half of the patients, cancer had grown at the end of the treatment. Cancer had grown in all patients 7 months after completing treatment. Some patients reported an improvement in their ability to work or do other activities, and other patients said their symptoms improved. These improvements, however, did not last after treatment ended.\"" This is what I wrote: \""A 1982 study found that while on Amygdalin therapy patients symptoms improved, though once taken off therapy the improvements didn't last. One patient's tumor decreased in size, and the rest either had no size change or increased.\"" This is what's written: \""A 1982 trial of 178 patients found that tumor size had increased in all patients. Minimal side effects were seen except in two patients who consumed bitter almonds and suffered from cyanide poisoning.\"" > Notice that the patients who consumed bitter almonds and had cyanide poisoning are not at all mentioned in the source. Perhaps it would be better to write: \""A 1982 trial of 175 patients found that while undergoing vitamin therapy and amygdalin injections, an improvement in symptoms was reported by some patients, while others reported that their ability to work or do other activities had improved. While on the therapy, one patients tumor mass decreased and approximately half had tumors increased in size. Seven months after therapy ended however, all patients tumors were found to have grown, and previous improvements reported did not last.\"" My feeling on that is, (though not to be written in the article), isn't obvious that after treatment stops the disease will continue to grow?

Also, a finding of fact is not the same as a prescription.  The Astral projection article contains flat statements of fact, but because it is, after all, \""Astral projection,\"" and because the experience itself is real -in fact, the OBE is a real experience of being out of the body, whether or not a spirit actually leaves-, and people's interpretations contain words such as \""spirit\"" which serve to warn the reader of controversy, this is not a bad thing.

What is clearly valid to one person can be clearly vandalism to another.  Sometimes people, in good faith, have different opinions.  That means that they need to work though their differences.  Sometimes that's not easy.  Now I don't know if Comaze has an extreme bias.  Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't.  I'm prepared to extend good faith to you and consider the possibility that he does.  I'm prepared to extend good faith to Comaze and consider the possibility that he doesn't.  But when you use words like 'fanatic' and 'zealot' and 'propaganda' and 'vexatious', it makes me go \""Oh oh.  This user doesn't care who he hurts if he gets his point across.\""  And that's bad.  You may be right about NLP.  I don't care.  Being right doesn't excuse you from being civil.  If you decend to being uncivil, you give people reasons to block you, regardless of whether or not you are right.  So the only way to get what you want is to keep your cool whatever the provocation. : Anyway, enough of the dump.

Well, of course there's strong popular feeling. Communalists on both sides have been using language as a proxy for Hindu-Muslim conflict ever since the 19th century. I'll take some responsibility for the initial mistake. Much of the language and organization of the basic article is mine, created in 2004. At that time I was a newbie WP editor and a comparative newbie to watching and understanding Bollywood. I then believed that there were two languages, Hindi and Urdu, and edited under that delusion. As I read and learned more, I changed my mind. However, many people (Indian and Pakistani) find it difficult to change their minds and admit that THEY (the people with whom WE are in a near-constant state of war and hostility) speak the same language that WE do. The dogma of nationalism, as imbibed from the West, teaches that states are defined by language communities (hence agitation to divide Indian states into language communities, such as the Telangana movement). If there isn't a common language, we'll insist on one. If there is one that we share, we'll deny sharing it. We'll make every effort (coining new Arabo-Persian or Sanskrit vocabulary words, using different alphabets) to differentiate OUR language from the same language as spoken by THEM.

Given that there would clearly many footnotes, it seemed that this was the easier and less complicated method, not only to create, but also to read. Second, I did not use the Harvard template to create and maintain the list of sources and when the occasional editor has wandered in and attempted to do so, I have reverted the changes. Inevitably they have made it part way through, with perhaps 3 or 4 paragraphs done, and then have given up.  According to the guidelines established by WP (again see[WP:CITE#Citation templates and tools]), no method is preferred, and that once a pattern is established it should be respected and sustained throughout the article.  \""The use of citation templates is neither encouraged nor discouraged.

The first time a source is cited, the footnote includes the entire citation; subsequent citations from that source are abbreviated with author and page number.  If there is more than one source by the same author, an identifying element from the source title is added for clarity.  Because there were over 100 citations from some 40 sources, I included also a bibliography, to make it easier for readers to find additional information on the subject without having to read through 100+ footnotes.  In addition, I included a second list of books that I did not cite, but which could inform someone's knowledge on the subject, if they decided to look further.  While material covered in this last section may also overlap with the material in the bibliography (sources cited), these sources were not \""specifically\"" cited. Finally, in many cases, I have included the link to the Google books page in the bibliography.  In most cases, I did not use the Google books version, but rather a hard copy, but have included the link to make it easier for someone reading the article to promptly find additional information.

Interton VC 4000 was the first multi-manufacturer console standard, not only does this give it historic value, it must have been reasonably popular for a dozen or more manufacturers to clone it. (Also was the first console version of a full computer, namely the TV Games Computer.) Same applies for Arcadia 2001.

There are simply too many consoles out there to list them all on a convenient template, so it makes sense to use the ones that were popular or came from highly regonized lineages (or at least widely advertised). :The template isn't putting down Europe (which simply isn't as big a market as America or Japan); many of these consoles were popular there too. The CD32 was simply a solo market failure, and actually the 3DO was the first 32-bit CD-based console.

Listing a machine because its ancestors were popular, and part of a \""great lineage\"" (a subjective term if ever I saw one!) does not make sense. By such reasoning you would have to include the Commodore 64GS console. And you would in fact have to also include the Amiga CD32, part of the great Amiga lineage. I will have to check on the timing of the release of the 3DO compared to the CD32, I suspect the CD32 may have been released first in Europe and the 3DO first in America or Japan.

Unfortunately I can't seem to find any sales numbers, those would be useful in figuring out how much of an impact it actually made. (I'm also not sure the 3DO belongs on this list... I didn't seem to get too popular either.) Also, I didn't remove the Interton, someone else did. You seem to be trying to act very \""patriotic\"" and defend any Europe-based console regardless of its actual success or impact, but we need to judge each console on a global scale, of which Europe is only a part. :\""Great lineage\"" isn't the most appropiate term, I agree. But when a certain console does an outstanding job in dominating the market (such as the Atari 2600, SNES, Sega Genesis or PlayStation), people will be curious about what happened to that brand, and it's good to keep them listed. But from what I can tell, the Amiga is a stand alone console from a company famous for its personal computers, not gaming consoles. :And the list isn't entirely American-centric as you'd want us to believe. For example, the Magnavox Odyssey2 was a console that had great success in Europe, higher than everywhere else.

First and foremost, this phrase does not add to the readability or comprehension of the sentence, section, or article. If you abstain from including it, I think you will find that the sentence still represents a coherent and focused idea. In fact, by adding the phrase, you add a context about date formats in the world that does not need to be implied on the article about Pi Day. It almost raises the question about where and who thinks it is more common. Further, the English Wikipedia does not prefer any major national variety of the language (See [WP:ENGVAR]). While this is a bit different than say, a British-English spelling difference, I think you can extend this to say Wikipedia does not prefer any date format as well. Why should we go down this road of creating a bias towards one date format when, as stated, the phrase does not add anything to the idea? And finally, if you do want to go down the road of preference, Pi Day has strong American ties (or more precisely, ties to users of month/day date format). The holiday was invented by American physicist Larry Shaw. The first celebration happened in the American city of San Francisco, CA. The holiday's roots are American.  Please see [WP:STRONGNAT]. So in fact, if \""the more common\"" is to be used anywhere, it should be used on the native American format. But, this is overkill, only to display that the phrase certainly should not describing day/month. As said, it shouldn't be said anywhere.

They are taken to somewhere in the USSR in circa 1992, somewhere cold and dreadful, where an idiotic scientest named Professor Boskov Mikahloshkotov, tries to turn them into deadly assassins, but... They end up being three goofy animals. The labrador is obnoxious and yet very crazy, the cat is somewhat intellegent and calm, and the wolf is addicted to anything edible or drinkable and is screwed up in the head. Boskov hates his experiments. To humiliate them, he names the labrador, Sillybonkers, and controls his mind so he keeps that name. He calls the cat, Wackno. And the wolf, Ajax. Then he tries to kill them. However, they escape and must find their place in the world. The first 10 episodes focus on them living in the Big Apple (New York City), and then to upstate New York, like in the woods. They occasionally move more around the states on episodes 19 to 30. After season one, they go worldwide. I think episode 51 (season 2 premiere) will have them in somewhere in the UK. Sound exciting?

And I also doubt that Khomeini wrote the book personally. The traditiom is like this: A Marja has a group of students. They will go and collect and write the book and even they will publish it and then they will bring one copy to the Marja for his signature. He will go through the book and will sign it and then the book will be distributed.  The reason is that the content of the book is not new. Any Marja has to have such a book and that is more of a formality. In these books there are many thing that are not practiced like eating insects. Neither khomeini nor any other Iranian eat insect. But these issues are in the book because 1400 years ago prophet talked about these things. The same is true for sex. But some anti-khomeini guys want to abuse it and say that khomeini was himself such a guy. If you do not believe in me see  page which is initiated by  who also initiated  [Tahrirolvasyleh].

For the record, I will not be arguing about that there; if Hardouin wants to voice further contention than he can open an RfC. What should happen in the article is that the language should change with context, and the context changes from section to section. Damn, analogies are condescending (sorry) but let's take the 'looking at the city from above' example again. For example, when we are talking about Paris' arrondissements, it is understood that we are talking only about Paris, so we 'zoom in' so that Paris' administrative limits fill the frame; in this context, only \""Paris\"" is needed. Yet when we talk about the Paris agglomeration, and have to 'zoom out' to show the entire thing, so it is understood that we are talking about the entire agglomeration (and not just Paris), so then it becomes necessary to use Paris intra-muros\"" (or \""Paris proper\"") when we are indicating (in that context) something in the city itself. When we move to the Paris economy, we have to zoom out to include the IDF (Paris region) because that's where the numbers are taken (even though Paris' actual economic activity is arguably in the agglomeration, but we're not here to write essays), so the context becomes 'Paris region' and phrases like \""Paris agglomeration' and 'Paris proper' are needed when smaller-area specificity is needed (if we're not referring to individual d\u00e9partements). When we zoom out yet again in the Demography section to include the aire urbaine so that we can study population/commuter activity in and around Paris, we again need the previous 'smaller area' language AND \""Paris region\"" (but here '\u00cele-de-France' would make that indication clearer) when the referenced numbers come from there. Yet when we move to city administration or history, we have to zoom in again where \""Paris\"" becomes the context again so \""Paris\"" becomes the only needed descriptor.

You'd have to look at the reference to find out the area they're covering - every 'list' has their own methods, normally this is indicated in brackets. If it is just the city, there'll be nothing. I think in a Green index it would be just the city.  Again, this is ranking, not territory. ::*3rd: That's fine! Since economy figures are taken over the Paris Region (\u00cele-de-France) anyway. These numbers are a bit 'padded', IMHO, because it includes areas not technically part of Paris' economy - but administratively and statisticly (economy-wise), Paris has its ass between two chairs (figures taken in departments, Paris' suburbs extend beyond its inner ring of departments) as far as numbers are concerned, and that's the best they can do for now. ::*4th: That's fine too! 'Paris region' and 'Paris economy' are synonymous, because that's where the numbers are taken (\u00cele-de-France). ::*5th: That's fine too... going back to what I was saying earlier, the 'context' becomes a 'zoom out' to the IDF, because that's what we need to do to get Paris' entire economy in the picture. :: As a solution to the 'IDF confusion', it would be good to start the section in explaining that the Paris economy (Paris-dependant and Paris-serving businesses, etc) extends well into the suburbs, and that the IDF is where it's measured. That's a damn good point, actually, as people who live here kind of take that as a 'given', but foreigners won't understand that. Actually, the context should be given in the first sentence of every section. It was like that before, but perhaps its been removed since. :: I frankly don't understand why those 'orders' to cut the history section were followed. I've tried to avoid looking at it, and Siefkin's on it I guess. Still, I wouldn't put individuals there unless it's absolutely necessary (we're talking about the history of the 'being' that is the city there - or I would do that, anyway). For individuals, what did they do in Paris? For Pasteur, I would have a \""Scientific research\"" section, there you can list its past and present accomplishments together. Isn't there a section about Paris' biggest 'specialty' industries, too? These should be a sub-section of Economy, but I suppose now it's just a mess of statistics and comparisons. Disneyland is a tiroir-caisse that does a lot for the area's economy... it's mentioned for that aspect ($$$!), not the touristy part.

Also, since Herriman is primarily remembered (for most people, I'd say only remembered) for his creation of Krazy Kat (which I personally believe to be the greatest cartoon strip ever)... wouldn't it make more sense to somehow introduce Krazy Kat much earlier in the article? Right now it's basically chronological, which throws the first mention of Krazy Kat quite far down. Wouldn't it make more sense to put that mention right in the first sentence somehow? Another point: I think the discussion of racial identity in Krazy Kat is fine, but it might leave a reader with the misimpression that that's primarily what the strip was about. Actually, the racial theme was only one of many in the strip; I believe that the majority of the strips had nothing to do with race. Also, there's no mention in the article that many people consider Krazy Kat to be the greatest (or one of the greatest) strips ever done, and no explanation of what made the strip so great. Perhaps this would be too 'point of view' for an encyclopedia, but it seems that without this, why should most people (not very familiar with Krazy Kat) even care about Herriman or realize why he's so special?"", ""timestamp"": ""2006-05-26 22:08:00 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""Talk:George Herriman"", ""user_text"": ""70.22.208.84"", ""parent_id"": ""55326684.618.618""}, ""129837953.1224.1224"": {""id"": ""129837953.1224.1224"", ""comment_type"": ""COMMENT_ADDING"", ""content"": "" How was he able to pass as white?  he's clearly part black."", ""timestamp"": ""2007-05-10 15:25:11 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""Talk:George Herriman"", ""user_text"": ""198.7.249.68"", ""parent_id"": ""55326684.618.618""}, ""129855372.1253.1253"": {""id"": ""129855372.1253.1253"", ""comment_type"": ""COMMENT_ADDING"", ""content"": "" : \""Clearly\"" to who?

This for a while was so extreme that some women weren't even given names nor did they go to school, they were expected to be in homes and take care of the family. Nowadays, since the [Kuomintang@nationalists] took the country in 1912, women have had the rights to attend school, get a job and overall have as much rights as a man in China. However social attitudes are still mostly the same as before and females are still treated as second class citizens in the family; parents still prefer to have a boy rather than a girl, perhaps worsened by the [One Child Policy], as they are seen as the heir to the family and are able to continue the family's surname, plus they are viewed as better financial providers once the parents have retired. It also because that when the daughter of the family gets married they \""in a sense\"" become a part of the groom's family. Examples of this is that their child will be born in the province/city where the groom's family comes from (if possible), plus the son/daughter will have the father's surname. Overall, Confucius and Confucianism in general have often been heavily criticized for promoting a view of women as socially inferior and subservient to men. However, it can be questioned how much this sort of misogynistic thinking really represents  Confucianism, and is not simply a product of traditional Chinese social values and customs established centuries ago. Nevertheless, the obstacle still remains for the modern Confucian to discover a way of reconciling Confucius' emphasis on traditional family/social roles with a modern understanding of women's rights."", ""timestamp"": ""2010-02-22 04:42:10 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""Talk:Confucianism"", ""user_text"": ""Wikinu~enwiki"", ""parent_id"": ""345600896.24713.22902""}, ""349933137.25655.25617"": {""id"": ""349933137.25655.25617"", ""comment_type"": ""COMMENT_ADDING"", ""content"": "" The basic principles of Confucianism are: Use right relationships to produce"", ""timestamp"": ""2010-03-15 03:04:15 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""Talk:Confucianism"", ""user_text"": ""98.234.117.107"", ""parent_id"": ""345600896.24713.22902""}, ""350188776.25617.25617"": {""id"": ""350188776.25617.25617"", ""comment_type"": ""COMMENT_ADDING"", ""content"": "" Yi (righteouness) Chinese character is \u7fa9"", ""timestamp"": ""2010-03-16 12:10:58 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""Talk:Confucianism"", ""user_text"": ""Sylvester Heart"", ""parent_id"": ""345600896.24713.22902""}, ""350190503.25631.25631"": {""id"": ""350190503.25631.25631"", ""comment_type"": ""COMMENT_ADDING"", ""content"": "" Chi (\u6065, judge and sense of right and wrong) \u6065 = according to Chinese dictionary shame, humiliation; ashamed!"", ""timestamp"": ""2010-03-16 12:26:15 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""Talk:Confucianism"", ""user_text"": ""Sylvester Heart"", ""parent_id"": ""345600896.24713.22902""}, ""350190503.25673.25631"": {""id"": ""350190503.25673.25631"", ""comment_type"": ""COMMENT_ADDING"", ""content"": "" (http://www.mandarintools.com/chardict.html - use \""paste a character\"")"", ""timestamp"": ""2010-03-16 12:26:15 UTC"", ""status"": ""just added"", ""page_title"": ""Talk:Confucianism"", ""user_text"": ""Sylvester Heart"", ""parent_id"": ""345600896.24713.22902""}}"

There is nothing in the text contradicting the idea of a \""British victory\"". And since this section deals both with the battle and its aftermath, we simply cannot ignore those sources which describe the consequences of the battle (i. e.: the destruction of the convoy, documented by an overwhelming number of authors). The reference to an Italian \""partial achievement\"" doesn't contradicts the fact of the British tactical victory; indeed, neither Mcintyre nor Stephen contradict themselves, since they are not dealing with the same subject. And if they are not dealing with the same subject (they are not putting in doubt the Royal Navy success), tell me please, where is the alleged \""undue weight\""? It is the same case of our discussion on \""tactical victory\"" and \""strategic victory\"" some months ago. Do you remember? You agreed then that a lonely source claiming an axis strategic success would be valid to support this idea, despite hundreds of authors asserting a British tactical victory. 3) You're miscounting the sources. The idea of partial achievement is supported not only by \""three sources\"" as claimed. The citations include not only Mcintyre, Stephen or Sadkovich, but Bauer and Young, Llewellyn, Simpson, and some Italian sources like Bernotti and Giorgerini. Then we have now 8 sources, already cited in footnotes. And, as exposed in point 2), this is an 8-0 ratio; the partial achievement of the Italian side doesn't contradicts the idea of a \""British victory\"", so this sources don't qualified as a \""minority view\"". 4) I strongly disagree with the proposed changes in the text of the section, since these seem to ignore the aftermath of the battle (the main subject of the title \""Assessments\"", I guess). The wording and the tone also seem unencyclopedic.

He later supported King Stephen, was a commander at the Battle of the Standard and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lincoln. Henry II prosecuted him for treason - allegedly because he was involved in a plot to poison the Earl of Chester, but commonly believed to be a sort of revenge for his support of King Stephen. The Earl of Chester died before he took possession of the Honour of Peverel. Sorry I'm not being precise in this, but citations and info is available. My main question to you is, do you think both warrent a stub - which admittedly at present would be quite small, or could both be put into one new article, or should all this go into the article on the first William? I'm sure both *could* warrent an article in the fullness of time, and I'm [leaning to giving them that scope for expansion. The 'honour' could hopefully detail the properties and land included - with some info about their subsequent ownership. 170 towns and villages in Nottinghamshire - lots of very notable buildings, inc Nottingham Castle. Perhaps searching for 'peverel', 'peveril' and similar should lead to a disambiguation page listing the two Williams, the book, and perhaps a mention of \""THE PEVERIL OF THE PEAK HOTEL\"" Derbyshire (big hotel), and I'm amazed that the Manchester pub doesn't have it's own article.

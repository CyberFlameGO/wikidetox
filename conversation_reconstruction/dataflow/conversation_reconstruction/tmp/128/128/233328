I hope to show that a wiki-based encyclopedia is not merely the same old encyclopedia with a different development and editing system, but a tool that allows types of content not easily integrated into conventional encyclopedias.\n\n\n\nI chose AtlasShrugged for this project for a few reasons.  I am familiar with it so can do a passable job in summarizing it.  It is very large and complex, making it a good test of what is possible.  Often people who are into AtlasShrugged are _really_ into it, so there are likely people who will contribute and who will be interested in the section.  There is a movie coming out, so interest in AtlasShrugged might be expected to surge soon - it would be good for the project if we were able to sate that interest with a really cool AtlasShrugged section.\n\n", "page_title": "Talk:Atlas Shrugged", "model": "wikitext", "page_namespace": "1", "page_id": "128", "rev_id": "233328"}

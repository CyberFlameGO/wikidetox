It mentions 3-valve instruments only in passing. Most student and intermediate models, however, are 3-valve, and seeing as most people don't play Euphonium past high school, 3-valve seems the norm to me... I haven't made any changes; what do you think?\n\n:Well, the valve number is not a defining attribute of the horn, but nontheless beginner models are not really representative of the instrument.  And anyway, if you give up after high school, do you really count as a true player? ;)  Dedicated players will generally use decent horns, and these will almost always have 4 valves. [[User:Diagonalfish|Diagonalfish]] 00:45, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\n:A great number of student and intermediate models are technically [[baritone horn|baritone horns]].  I'm not saying that this is the defining characteristic - I've seen four valve baritones and three value euphoniums.  The 3 valve baritone and 4 valve euphonium are the standard, though, and have been since major instrument makers decided to call their lower models baritones and their higher models euphoniums, which caused all this confusion to begin with.  -[[User:JJLeahy|JJLeahy]] 06:40, 16 July 2005 (UTC)\n\nWell in British nomenclature (and in brass bands internationally) the baritone and the euphonium have always been separate instruments. The baritone is smaller and has a narrower bore, hence a less 'mellow' sound - more horn-like. I've used these instruments from 50-yr-olds to the latest and greatest, but all the euphoniums I've ever seen have had four valves; for the baritone, four valves have been introduced on some models over the last few years. [[User:82.36.75.208|82.36.75.208]] 21:49, 21 July 2005 (UTC)\n:See 'Naming Issues' in the Tenor Horn article for more info on this - sorry, not sure how to link to it. [[User:Xyster|Xyster]] 21:55, 21 July 2005 (UTC)\n\n:Great confusion surrounds this issue, so I\u00b4m not 100% sure, but I believe DiagonalFish is correct and JJLeahy may be mistaken.  The old-school bell-front horn with 3 front-action valves is still a euphonium and not a baritone because it is conical-bore (as witnessed by the fact that the tubing grows wider before the bell).  Though for whatever reason publishers, composers and band directors all started calling these instruments \"baritones,\" I do not believe any beginning player has actually played a ''true'' baritone.  The first time I ever played or even saw one was when I got to college and played in a British-style brass band, which has euphoniums and baritones.  Once you have seen and heard a true baritone there is no mistaking them because the baritone looks and sounds completely different (it appears about 2/3 the size of a euphonium).  In any case, DiagonalFish is certainly right in that the most common model of an instrument should be judged by what the professionals play; otherwise beginner models would the be the most common of every instrument because there are more beginning players than professionals.  A euphoniumist - and yes I do regard that as the proper term - could not now hope to win a job in any military service band without a 4-valve, compensating horn.  -[[User:NetherlandishYankee|NetherlandishYankee]] 13:36, 23 December 2005 (UTC)\n\n== Double Bell Euphonium ==\n\nThis was copied from talk pages - I specifically wanted to put it on [[User:Diagonalfish|Diagonalfish's]] [[User talk:Diagonalfish|talk page]] because of his/her edits specifically with the double bell euphonium.  I'm pasting it here so that we might get a more comprehensive discussion. (A few things were tastefully edited.)\n\n:I was just wondering about the edits to euphonium regarding the double bell euphonium.  From my experience, the tubing from the switch to the smaller bell is nearly cylindrical, which gives it a trombone-like sound.  It was used by notable soloists around a hundred years ago because it gave the player two voices - so it could give the illusion that the soloist was having a duet with himself/herself.  The pitch variation may have existed, but I have a hunch that it was more a flaw of the instrument.  I got most of my information from a research paper I did a year ago of the history of the euphonium, and the information I got from my Tuba/Euph professor (one day he had it in the studio and let me play it a bit).\n\n:Let me know how this varies with other understandings of the horn, and maybe we can write a paragraph in the article that benefits from our mutual understanding. -[[User:JJLeahy|JJLeahy]] 17:55, 25 September 2005 (UTC)\n\n::As for the tone quality of the extra bell on the double-belled euphonium, I have actually played a real specimen at the [http://bandmuseum.tripod.com/ Band Museum] in my city.

Gilmore band introduced the instrument to the United States in 1888 and it was the standard instrument until Harold Brasch brought the British-style compensating euphonium here in 1939 and probably later[http://www.nd.edu/~baritone/history.html].  The same source states that double-belled euphoniums were sold in Conn catalogs into the 1960\u00b4s, and as late as 1977, Jan Bach wrote specific instructions on performance practice on double-belled euphonium for his seminal work ''Concert Variations''.

Also, all the current top players I know of use four valve models.\n\nThe only things I found that resemble 5-valved euphoniums are non-compensating Courtois saxhorns (compare http://www.courtois-paris.com/panneaubrasssax.html) which I consider a French specialty and which Courtois probably offers as an alternative to four valve compensating models.\n\n\n* I agree with you on the 5 valves; I've never heard of it and I was going to post something similar to what you did.  I think you were right to delete it from the article.  Also, about the whole \"the valve issue\" section you added... it's very thorough, you obviously have a lot of knowledge, but is there any way to incorporate some/most of it into the article on Brass Instruments or Valves?  Some of it seems non euphonium-specific and the addition of a section of that length kind of slows down the article a little.  Not contesting the value of your contribution, just wonder if maybe there's a better venue for it.\n\n-[[User:NetherlandishYankee|NetherlandishYankee]] 22:39, 21 February 2006 (UTC)", "parentid": 40626150, "page_title": "placeholder", "model": "placeholder", "page_namespace": "placeholder", "page_id": 476334, "rev_id": 40627557}

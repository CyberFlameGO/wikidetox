<p dir="ltr">We are interested in identifying toxic comments in online discussions.
  Please use the following definition of toxicity as a guide:</p>

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">A <strong>toxic comment</strong> is a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is  somewhat likely to make someone leave a discussion, engage in fights, or give up on sharing their perspective.</li>
	<li dir="ltr">Toxicity should not be confused with civil disagreement.
	</li>
</ul>

	<li dir="ltr">The section title of the conversation (in the format ==section title==);</li>
	<li dir="ltr">The comments making up the conversation.</li>
